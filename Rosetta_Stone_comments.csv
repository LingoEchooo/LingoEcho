If they actually attempted proper localization, it might be worth it. 

But it loses to Busuu, Memrise, Babbel, and even Duolingo in that regard. Duolingo used to have a specific topic for asparagus in German. That was great! I don't even like Duolingo; it's wrong in a different way. But at least there is some localization going on."

It was quite popular in the days before Duolingo, etc., but I think a lot of the skepticism just comes from the fact that there's now a saturation of language learning apps and methods, all of which dubiously claim to be more effective than traditional approaches without any real evidence to support that. RS does more or less the same thing as other app-based methods, and gets more or less the same result.

To their credit, they've maintained more product integrity than Duolingo (which once had some redeeming features on its more comprehensive courses but is now basically useless) or Memrise, which was once my preferred platform for vocab study before they purged all community courses. Mango is still the gold standard IMO."

I also never hear people give their alternatives when they bash RS.

You don't like it for that reason, but others like learning languages this way or via video games or playing them with the native-speaking community.  

From a teaching perspective, it's important to acknowledge that students have the entire spectrum of motivation or lack thereof, for example, those who need to finish a two-year requirement to graduate and care only about passing. Outside the classroom, this still applies. People can be extremely motivated to get it done for a specific goal while others are just casually learning or personal enjoyment with no concrete goal, so gravitating toward things that are free, low-cost, low investment is understandable. 


I wouldn't use Rosetta Stone because I have other options. It's my idea to just audit a class one of my colleagues will be teaching during my free period. I can borrow the mats.  For speaking practice, I pay a sub to a language service/school; I'm currently using WorldsAcross."

Babbel is fantastic for teaching grammar, which is beneficial but can also be very difficult for first-time second-language learners. It launches into verb conjugations right from the beginning before a student has acquired any real vocabulary.

Duolingo, in my opinion, is the easiest of the three, but probably not the best. It gradually introduces grammar indirectly through context and introduces new vocabulary very rapidly. There is a lot of repetition, which is beneficial because it aids in memorization. One downside of Duolingo is that it is almost solely based on translation instead of immersion. This approach teaches students to mentally translate everything from the target language to their mother tongue and vice versa. In my opinion, it is better to learn to think and speak directly in the target language without mentally translating anything at all.

Each of these three options has its pros and cons, but overall, I prefer Rosetta Stone the most. It doesn't teach grammar directly, but you will acquire it the same way a baby learns to speak. What I like most about Rosetta Stone is that it offers full immersion in the target language with no translation from the learner's first language. This approach encourages students to think directly in the target language without mentally translating anything."

Fortunately, these two are by far not the only options.

>It is extremely difficult to achieve any level of conversational fluency wihtout being totally immersed in a language,

No, it's not. It takes time, efforts, and solid tools. Difficult, but definitely possible. But no, it is not extremely difficult. This is just an excuse that bad teachers and bad resource sellers are convincing people of, to cover for their failings.

>i have found great success in doing to the core lessons of RS

Good. Tell us more. What level have you achieved? What skills? How were you able to progres from there?

I am not saying RS is completely useless, I know a few people that used it as a supplemental set of flashcards with audio in langauges with few beginner resources. But noone, who used it as the main resource and got anywhere at all.

>You might say that sounds expensive.

Not exactly. I'd say it's expensive even for free. Back when I did the demo version and considered downloading the pirated version for free, I found out it was such a waste of time and lost opportunity, that even my hard drive space was too much of an investment :-D

>If you disagree, tell me what you prefer.If you disagree, tell me what you prefer.

It all comes down to your learning style, preference, affective factors, your goals, knowing what you can get from it, etc.

It's definitely not for everyone, but it does have its place in the language learning community: for those who like the challenge of learning the language intuitively, a more “natural” way, without translation or explanations. You have to use your intuition to decode the language, like a puzzle or a guessing game - maybe that’s why this course divides people’s opinions: it’s either “love or hate it”.

Some people hate to study grammar and theory, they prefer to see and feel how the language works - those will enjoy Rosetta Stone. Others feel lost and need to understand every detail, those will hate the program.

But it can feel slow and repetitive. The first units are designed to introduce simple language concepts intuitively, so you will practice useful sentences for conversation only after that. But if you want the challenge of immersion and are not in a rush, this is the way to go.

You can expect to reach an upper basic or low intermediate level. Consider that B1 requires 300-400 hours of study for easier languages. Install a time tracker on your phone, press ""play"" every time you sit down to study... once you reach 300 hours, then you'll feel the difference. You can't expect a miracle before that with whatever material you use.

I wouldn’t rely on any single app to reach that level. You could start with whatever app or course (Assimil, Linguaphone, Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone, etc.) and then move on to some material made in Italy specifically designed for that exam. Look for traditional Italian textbooks, they have a number of good series - they also teach you culture, which could be fundamental to pass the exam."

I can recommend it for learning a language from scratch. I really don't get all the negative comments about it.

Maybe it's just because of my learning style, but I love the immersive approach and precisely the fact that they are not explaining anything. Yes, there is a lot of repetition, but that's absolutely needed if you want words to go into your subconsciousness. And by the way, you shouldn't introduce new grammar with new vocabulary and also not the other way around. And that's where I feel like RS excels. While you are repeating some sentences, suddenly a new grammatical topic slips into the practice, like negation, for example.

There's one caveat, though: If you have no good understanding of grammatical concepts either in your mother tongue or in any other language you've learned, a lot of things in RS might be missed by you.

And finally, by just using RS like a game that you have to complete, it will not work for you. If there are things that you don't get, try to search for answers or repeat the thing until you get it. It is the searching for answers that will eventually make a topic stick in your memory.

P.S. Please don't expect an app to teach you how to actively speak a language. It is already a huge success if you can get good listening skills, get a grasp of its structure and grammar and learn a new alphabet. Activating all that knowledge and becoming an active speaker will only be achieved by actual interaction, either in written or spoken form."

It has always been about tons of marketing. And even back then, like 10 years ago, I did a demo and decided even a free pirated version was a waste of my time and my computers memory. :-D

However, there are some learners, finding value in RS: Learners of languages with few resources, who have a different and more systematic primary resource (typically a coursebook), and they get RS as a set of flashcards with audio. That kind of use of RS seems to be valuable, as there are few alternatives.

>I have used a lot of language learning apps over the years and none of them have helped much for real life situations. I would love an app that would simulate a conversation instead of just giving me flashcards and games but as far as I know, that doesn't yet exist.

This is the problem. Independent language learning does not equal apps! Apps are usually the worst tools, just toys to get your money (directly or through ads). Real learners usually rely on coursebooks as the starting point.

You are lucky. These days, there is something in between. More and more publishers are making digital interactive versions of their coursebooks and workbooks. You get the high quality content, but you do it on computer, the audio is there at the right places accessible with one click (you no longer search for it in an mp3 or CD), autocorrective exercises (no more searching in a key). It is a very convenient way to learn, even though I'd still recommend everyone to also write their exercises by hand, and so on."

That deal, that 50% off? Been going on for a long time now. My partner just asked me if we should get the lifetime through their work discount.

Initially got excited by their lifetime offer but now see that it's pretty much permanent? Maybe that's because it has gone down hill. I did read that it was bought by another company in 2021. Does anyone know if it went downhill because of that? Or it's always been the way people are describing in this thread? Personally? I like Duolingo after trying different apps. Free was good but my partner is now paying for annual family for the paid version. Which is nice. But expensive. It's worth it if you use it. But use their free version first before paying.

I tried remaining on the free choice for a while after the trial but it was 100% frustrating and annoying so I paid the fee. Think about how much you spend on other junk.

I tried using Rosetta Stone recently and I wouldn’t even sign up for another free trial. 

Duolingo’s format has gone stale, and they’re trying to monetize an old product, by removing the free features slowly but surely. They are running on past glories.

When a company speaks a big game about making learning free, and then actively handicaps the users of the free product, that is a huge concern.

I also wouldn’t pay for Duolingo as all of those AI features can be gotten for free on ChatGPT.

Most people using Duolingo today, show off their streak as a status symbol. That’s all it is.

People are spending their time here and on the app to give constant feed-back on the courses and new ideas on how to improve the learning experience for everyone. Duolingo makes money on that. As I understand, even most of the classes were originally conceptualized by volunteers.

People are putting in the work, they are entitled to criticize and complain if management implements sanctions against them. I see it a little bit like telling a coworker who just got the news he needs to get by with a 10% wage cut - ""well, its companies doing company things"". That's neither great help nor very farsighted from a person who works for the same company.

But yeah, in case of Duolingo it's worse. They definitely try to exploit their position as near-monopoly, and since they don't have a direct competitor, people can't jump ship without also losing the ability to learn and practice language on an app. I wish some of the trillions being poured into AI by investors ended up creating a free Duolingo competitor (it will almost inevitably switch to a paid version at some point, but for a few years we would at least have a good alternative)."

You can play it as a game or you can use it to supplement your language learning. 

You don't learn to form your own sentences. You never have to read anything complex. Learning only by intuition and familiarization means you cannot conjugate new verbs freely. You never get to listen to how real people talk. All you do is slowly increasing your vocabulary and train yourself to recognize patterns.

I say this is someone with a 800+ day streak, who has met people with even longer streaks. I've learned more in a single week of intensive language learning in a class environment (30 h in a week) than in a year of using Duolingo. I'll keep using it, because maintaining the streak has value for me. I don't always have time or motivation to study properly, but I can always spend 3 minutes to do a lesson and get at least a little bit of input. But I do my real learning by following reddit subs in target language, reading books, listening to music and watching tv series.

I did another 2 weeks of intensive language learning at a language school this year. Lots of other students there that also got started with Duolingo and you know what they all had in common? They all did very well on the online multiple choice placement test and then had to switch courses to a much lower level, because they couldn't understand their teachers and they couldn't express themselves at all. 

You have to imagine, these were people that have spent years learning that language on Duolingo and they couldn't keep up with people that had arrived at that language school just 2 weeks earlier who had zero knowledge of that language beforehand."

I have been a serious free user since 2019 and I’ve been able to learn for free up to midway B2-early level in Spanish (whilst maintaining my presence in the Diamond League for over 100 consecutive weeks) until my MAX mishap. 😅


It’s very possible to learn seriously on the free level. Failing (losing hearts) presented a challenge for me. It meant I had to be focused while learning. I was able to go through multiple lessons without losing all 5 hearts. I went weeks without ever losing all 5 hearts. I also wasn’t dependent on practicing to regenerate hearts. 


Free users gain more diamonds per lesson, so it was easier to accumulate diamonds. I saved those diamonds and amassed 21k+ diamonds. It was easy for me to refill my hearts without fear. I was also offered duo SUPER preview for a week on multiple occasions. During these free SUPER weeks, I carried out legendary exercises and all other things that would normally have cost me diamonds. 


For me being a free user was an added challenge that kept me on my toes and made me devise new strategies for learning. I also used Spanish Dict alongside side Duolingo so save new words I learned on Duolingo because I didn’t have access to the premium-user flashcards. Even now I’m on MAX, I still use Spanish dict for my vocabulary lists.

1. Rosetta Stones claims to be all through examples but no explanations of grammar etc. like how babies learn their native language. That’s bullshit, parents correct and explain all the time, and it adds up.

2. I learned how to say declarative facts, but not basic conversation. The horse is running. Two girls are eating bread. I was on it pretty faithfully for a year then went to a conversation group couldn’t take what I’d learned and have even basic conversations.

3. It teaches you inconsequential things before important things. I knew how to say “the man is giving the girl a piggy back ride” before a lot of other far more practical things.

4. As a native English speaker how the hell was I supposed to figure out that counter suffixes existed. Didn’t catch on until later when I read it in a book. Also originally thought めがね was makeup because “the man is wearing ___”, it was his wedding, looked like maybe there was something there, the woman in the other example was wearing makeup. That one may have been on me.

It wasn’t useless, I got a lot of vocabulary out of it, and later went to a tutor for a while who said my pronunciation was good, but as a standalone tool and for as much as it cost, it sucked. I got more out of books and then some practice with other people."

Use genki 1 and 2 and quartet. 

Follow tokini andys explanations of the grammar. 


Use bunpro for reps. So you get practice with the grammar. 

And use wanikani for Kanji. 

Use anki for repetition and reinforcing everything. 

Once you've finished genki 2 you should begin reading graded readers and joining the book clubs in wanikani forums to use their discussions and vocabulary/grammar lists to help you read. 


This will get you all the way to n2 without need for other resources. 

You can finish genki 1 in 2
3-4 months as a responsible adult who also has to sleep and work.

 If japanese is all of your freetime you can finish it in 1 month. Most colleges finish it in 3 quarters or semesters. 

Same goes for genki 2.


The issue with colleges outside of Japan is most people are learning with the intention of keeping up with the curriculum and aren't getting the proper one on one practice they need nor explanations. 

They learn and dump the knowledge after every test, midterm, and final. Mostly because they're also busting their butts on their other two or three classes that semester. 

If you learn to remember. 

And force yourself to have 100% retention of grammar/vocab/Kanji from each lesson BEFORE going on to the next, you'll actually be able to use that knowledge as it comes up again later in your text. 


I went through both genki 1 and 2 with two 12-13 years old last year [relative and her bff] and they passed n4 in 10 or so months while also being involved in school and jiu jitsu. 

They are consuming a lot of media in Japanese now and working on quartet with a real tutor now."

It's just when apps take the ”gamify"" approach to things for example Duolingo or rosetta stone, they give you the feeling of improving but in actuality the gains you get are minimal at best. It doesn't mean you won't be able to learn some things, but you would be 90% more effective doing other things like textbooks, online grammar guides or hell jumping into immersion.

It also feels like people have a list of resources that outnumber their Japanese vocabulary lol. Someone else said it but I believe Rosetta stone expects you to be its only resource - and thats the case with ALOT of these programs. You're not helping improve separate aspects of your japanese one at a time, you're usually instead starting from scratch each and every time you pick up a new resource.

I remember this happened to me a lot when I first started ""learning"" years ago. Pick up Duolingo, try a bit of lingodeer, delve into a grammar guide and then only read a chapter or two then give up. Then find a totally new resource and the cycle just repeats.

If you're gonna learn the language then settle with something you're content with, find some graded readers or some comprehensive content on youtube to hear how real Japanese sounds / can be used. Continue with the Genki if thats what works for you because grammar is super important. And then keep at it. Anki is pretty useful too if you're willing to put in the effort or if you want to find a premade deck."

Basically, where a college textbook will get you started with useful phrases/conversations, provides explanations such as grammar, and leverages your knowledge of your own language to help you learn a new language, Rosetta Stone opts to treat you like a small child and throw phrases at you and let you figure them out -- you learned by hearing until you picked up meaning as a small child, so they assume you should do that as an adult, too.

It can be demotivating to see no real world results. It can drain confidence because rather than question the program, you assume it's your fault for not working hard enough. And you might be locked into thinking that's the only way to learn. 

Even more so, bad influences can spread. As an example earning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, etc) have been a myth for a very long time, and it's quite damaging for people to believe they can only learn in a particular way and not try to learn when their ""style"" isn't available.

Rosetta Stone prides itself on learning like a native, but that's kind of a shit way to learn as an adult. Spending 5 years and being able to speak like a 5 year old isn't very good.

A 5 year old can't explain intricacies to pretty much anything.

1. The program misses the whole point of optimal learning. It's not about learning like a child does because children are good at learning languages.
It's that child are surrounded by that language 24/7 and have to spend their every waking moment in that language, including thinking in it.

You're not going to get fluent spending 3 hours a week on resetta stone, just like you won't become fluent if you live in Japan but work an English speaking remote job and only go out once a week to see your expat friends.

2. Just like you said, when nothing is explained except through pictures, only basic level of understanding can be conveyed.
Sure, 男の子はジュースを飲んでいます can be seen as the boy is drinking juice, but even that is annoying because you have to have multiple sentences to realize 男の子 is boy. 

We are adults. We can understand high concepts, and just having someone tell you 男の子 means boy is infinitely faster.

And then how do you explain something like ""she lamented in her past trauma, but in the end it brought her to despair too much she couldn't take this world any longer.""
過去のトラウマに嘆いてきたが、最終的にはそれが絶望の淵まで追いやり、もうこの世界を耐えられなくなった

The difference there is that they have a nice grammar index to reference. So I paid for it, copied it all to an Anki deck and stopped. Rosetta Stone doesn’t offer what Bunpro does and is cheaper as well. 

Anki does tell you if something is right or wrong. That’s probably why people are so up in arms against RS, because a nice alternative exists. Anki though is bland looking, and difficult to fully navigate or take advantage of, among other things. It definitely would be hard for a beginner to take on. RS’s place would be at this stage, but that’s not what they advertise. 

I think the main thing here is that if you understand it takes more than just RS to succeed, then it’s probably fine."

I work in IT as an engineer and I deal with all the Japanese clients like Sony etc. they require a very high level of carefully worded emails and phone calls, so I go over my keigo with a private tutor every couple weeks.

In the beginning of learning Japanese, I would read a chapter of genki by myself, then at the end of the week go over the chapter with a private tutor. They would give me homework go do and then I would read the next chapter. I found it more effective and cheaper to essentially have the tutor go over what I had already read, and explain the parts I didn't understand, and correct the things I got wrong."

This sub is focused on learning Japanese, and by being inherently that, people are going to lean towards more effective ways of learning the language. 

Japanese is a weird language out of the pool of languages, because there is a tremendous amount of people learning the language compared to how many actual fluent people there are, and because of this there is a lot of gatekeeping.

Rosetta Stone is by no means an efficient way to study the language. But it's also better to do something that is fun than something that isn't.

- Want to work in Japan in 2 years? Rosetta Stone isn't the right path for you.

- Want to show your inner circle that you are learning another language as a hobby? Why should it matter the method you are doing it?

Why should someone study extrenuously in a method they don't like if it's a hobby of theirs. I thought hobbies were supposed to be fun.

But then you have to think, if you hate traditional study that much, is Japanese really for you? Are you really going to stick to it to get to any decent speaking ability? What is the point of knowing a language of all you can talk about is the weather and what you ate for breakfast.

People just have to get out of this delusion that an app will make you fluent. And also in that regard, it's a stepping stone just like the genki books are.

You aren't going to be anywhere near fluency after genki 2. I've read probably over 20 Japanese textbooks at this point. But genki was my first text book too (I actually started with Rosetta Stone years before and quit lol)

It'll all end with reading and listening to native material if you truly want to be fluent."
Surprisingly Impressed by Rosetta Stone- Does anyone else actually like this program?,iblameinternetaccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/x29yb2/surprisingly_impressed_by_rosetta_stone_does/,RyanSmallwood,"Not using translation is a cool feature, though last I heard the program limits you so you can’t move on or preview other lessons until you finish the earlier ones. If this is still the case this is a very slow way to learn and not how the brain prefers to learn things where it helps to be primed for what it going to learn first, see a variety of content and let it sink in. I believe all the courses are translated from the same template, meaning they don’t organize grammar concepts as well for all languages, don’t teach any cultural info, and don’t teach the most useful vocabulary.

It can probably be a good supplement, again if it’s free, but unless they fix some other issues I don’t see it being that appealing of a main option. And there are so many ways to quickly generate study materials from more interesting, useful, and memorable content these days, apps really have to change their approach to stay useful. Although it does seem like Rosetta Stone’s language selection might still make them useful in a few cases where good tools like that don’t exist yet."

* a brilliant idea

As you said, if it's offered for free (or at a far lower price), then it's not bad. My two personal gripes (setting aside price) were that I found it boring and not localized appropriately for more distant languages. The first is a matter of taste (again, I liked the concept, but not RS's execution of it); the second is (in my book) inexcusable given its huge budget."

The flaw in its method is that it has a speed limit built in, and I don’t think there’s really a way for them to get around that.

I paid for the spanish course maybe 2018 and found it immensely underwhelming because I was able to complete it in less than a couple of weeks (yes, the entire course) yet did not advance at all in my judgment

fast forward to the pandemic, I started doing italki lessons weekly and got fluent in less than 12mos (already had a base, granted) and supplemented with other stuff like podcasts, books, youtube, etc.

so in my mind, yes you can spend $500 on the software, or you can spend a similar amount on lessons with a real live tutor and actually make more progress plus get real time feedback

re: difficulty incorporating into work & life, I'd recommend having a set time where you're focused on the language at a certain time of day/week and make it sacred. tutors around the world so you should be able to find a time slot that you can regularly make. beyond that, just change your life to be in german (podcasts, subtitles, TV, etc.)

Also, more specifically with Rosetta Stone - it might be more or less useful to you depending on your learning style. If you're a very visual learner, you might like it more than a lot of people here seem to. It tries to immerse you in the language from the start by associating images with phrases, and that sort of thing can click with visual learners.

Other than that, it is inefficient, doesn't lead to too good results, and it must be really stressful with all the guessing (which is also a risk of learning mistakes due to wrong assumptions of how the language works)."

Rosetta Stone isn't for everyone, as it has its own unique way of teaching. I for one really like it. It begins with simple words, then strings them together for larger sentences. There is speaking, matching, typing, pronunciation and other types of lessons. One of the things that I love about it is there is no translating. No ""type this sentence into English."" Just pure German the whole time. Since you are A2-B1, the beginning will feel easy, but you will progress quickly. I think it is worth the money, but others may not. I wish I could be of more help. Good luck with your learning :)"

is rosetta stone effective?,zenobia267,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/1bexgwk/is_rosetta_stone_effective/,ExitingBear,"Caveat:  I haven't done Rosetta stone in German.

I have tried it in two other languages.  For one, it made sense (logically), the progressions made sense and matched the language.  I felt like what I was doing now built on what I did earlier.  I could see similarities between groups of words that were introduced together in that language.  I would get phrases that matched the words I'd just learned.  It flowed.

The other language had a very different grammar and structure - but **everything** was in the same order as the first language. So, nothing made sense.  Instead of ""here's a word; here's a phrase that uses that word"" it was ""here's a word;  here's a bunch of new words.""  In the first language ""see the pattern in these four examples? see if you can make some connections for future use.""  in the second ""there are 3 different patterns in these four examples because of the way this language handles this situation.  We're also not going to explicitly tell you what's going on.  So, good luck with that.""

I don't know which side German Rosetta Stone will fall on.   But if it's on the wrong side, it could be very frustrating."

>A group of Egyptian archeologists is hoping to change that, renewing a plea to return the Rosetta Stone back to its birthplace.

> The Rosetta Stone was found in 1799 by French soldiers during Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt.

> It has been on display at the British Museum since 1802, and the former colonizers of Egypt really don't want to give it back.

> The stone is part of a larger stone slab with a message inscribed in three different transcripts; hieroglyphics, demotic, and Ancient Greek.

> As the British Museum notes on its website, the Rosetta Stone is, ""One of the most famous objects in the British Museum,"" even though the stone signifies the country's colonial history.

> Aside from the Rosetta Stone, the British Museum has tons of stolen artifacts that it refuses to return to their rightful owners.

> In August, the British Museum agreed to return 72 artifacts that were looted from Nigeria over a hundred years ago during a British military invasion back to the Nigerian government.

Should it be given to the French, who are the ones that found it?

The stone would have no value if it wasn't studied by the French and English archaeologists and tbh would likely have been destroyed eventually if they had not found it. 

Over the centuries a lot of things were found or bought that had no value at the time, after being preserved for a few hundred years in a museum these countries want these things they discarded back. Some more high profile things were forcibly taken at the time though, so for those there is a more legitimate argument that they should be returned."
Egypt Wants Its Rosetta Stone Back From the British Museum,redhatGizmo,https://gizmodo.com/egypt-wants-its-rosetta-stone-back-1849626582,Civil_Fun_3192,"Not worth it. This artifact, and ones like it, are so old that they're more part of humanity's collective heritage than any modern nation state (and to claim continuity between the modern Egyptian state and ancient Egypt is a stretch). Keeping them safe and giving scholars access to them supersedes Egypt's desire to profit from them, but it's not the end of the world if it goes back.

I would also note, as someone that has an interest in ancient history, that in spite of the fake outrage you hear online about the British Museum's ""stolen artifacts,"" a) the Museum's collection was mostly purchased or donated legitimately by guys like Hans Sloane, and b) the amount of funding, research, and the valuations on these artifacts suggests that the level of public interest in these items is actually quite low."

The argument for returning antiquities is a good one but on the other hand, if they want the visitors they should make people want to visit, and more stuff isn’t necessarily the solution. Tourists coming to see the  Rosetta Stone won’t make them more money than the money they’d already make off of the visits to the pyramids and artifacts they already have in museums. They should also focus on improving their citizens lives before trying to get these items back. The people of Egypt are likely gearing up for more unrest in the coming decade, so it may not be in the best interest to return Egyptian artifacts over other countries asking for their artifacts.

How Museums got their treasures"". In it, he breaks down the four main categories of acquisition (of which plunder and theft is one of them), but legal acquisition is an extremely large portion."

As I said above though there's good and bad I think for any museum to return things straight away, if we look back to Syria in somewhat recent years when ISIS was very active and the sheer destruction that was caused to the super rich history the country has which is then gone.

All of human history up until the last couple of hundred years virtually doesn't matter because gas/oil and mechanization replaces manpower as the builder of civilization in many cases hundreds of times to 1. The lingering effects of colonialism are very much over stated. Some social systems just haven't adapted well, and no one wants to be at the back end of the world so the first world is hugely advantaged. A country that makes all the right choices can modernize in a few decades. Humans are humans you can't blame them for not doing that, and it's harder not being at the head of the pack, but you ever watch those most dangerous roads shows?

The Spanish conquered America by exploiting divisions - many tribes hated the Mexica and the Inca had recently had a devastating civil war. The British did a similar thing in India, exploiting the rivalries of the various princes etc. In both cases their armies were far too small to conquer the native peoples alone, even with the slight technological advantage - and it was only slight. They had muskets, not machine guns.

The same in Africa where it was pretty deadly for Europeans due to the various diseases so until the later part of the 19th Century, it was very difficult to occupy much of the continent. Therefore the slaves were sold to Europeans by other Africans because ""African"" is not more united than ""European"" - they were different nations and ethnic groups and considered themselves completely different. 

Hell, some countries like Dahomey basically built their economy around it.

It doesn't mean that the slave traders and plantation owners weren't evil, of course they were, but it wasn't simply due to some super powerful ""white man"" either."

And the best you can hope for is that if they see you as their property that they won't want to damage their own possessions too much. Your local tyrant has a slight vested interest in keeping you alive while any invader might just kill everyone and take everything. European colonialism existed for the blink of an eye when technology made possible expansion without invasion or eradication. In the absolute worst cases only a fully genocidal conquest was worse, but in most cases the people weren't eradicated and the violence was large and public rather than enforced individually to each and every person.

I didn’t just mean the country Egypt to modern times, but they also have incredible collections of Greek, Roman,  Chinese, etc artifacts. Again I’m not saying they shouldn’t be returned, but the fact you can travel around the world AND through time in a single place is something we might not be able to do in 30 years, so it’s worth it in my opinion. 

I agree the British should return many of the artifacts, especially ones that were clearly stolen. The Ottomans were quite generous with British archaeologists when it came to Greek artifacts, and basically let them take whatever they wanted from both Anatolia and Greece proper. Something like the Parthenon marbles should be returned in my opinion, but there are also abandoned Greek temples from modern day Turkey that I think could be fine to stay, for example.

But again, my point wasn’t to argue whether they should be returned, but just point out there will likely never be as comprehensive of a collection of human artifacts in a single location, so if you’re a history buff it’s a very convenient and cheap way to see this stuff without needing to travel to 80 countries."

Are words you chose to add for no reason whatsoever. The process of conquest is always violent. Nearly always the ruling elite later chose to actually rule the land, instead of choosing to gleefully commit genocide. The exceptions are remembered precisely because they are the exceptions. People either pillaged and left, or settled down and ruled. Colonialism is unique in that the pillaging was systematized while deliberately sabotaging any possibility of providing for the legal needs of a populace.

You’re right that whether or not it’s better or worse than death is subjective, it’s why I said “some” in my original comment. The point I was trying to make is that we can’t downplay the struggles and trauma they’ve went through. And how they as victims of colonisation choose to work though that trauma cannot be decided by the abuser. Take Indigenous Australians for example, the effects of colonisation on them is still felt extremely heavily to this day. There are still a lot of efforts being made towards reconciliation and decolonisation and in some cases, cannot be done without a complete revamp. They’ve started but the journey to recover what was lost is so long that there definitely are people who have decided that death was the only option.

Their culture also treats their historical artifacts as though it had an agency and soul of its own. There is undoubtedly significance in returning the objects to their land of origin but the British museum would rather keep it in storage."

All artifacts that can travel with care from curators should be cycled internationally between museums semi-regularly. All artifacts that can't should be returned if possible. 

While I get that people get covetous of their cultural artifacts especially in light of violent colonist invasion and theft, people don't become cosmopolitan just by staring at old pots from their own country. Touring artifacts is a good way to teach one another about our cultures.

The stone was found in a fortification near the town of Rosetta. As in, it was literally found \*in\* the fortification. The Egyptians had gathered up a bunch of stonework from an ancient temple, broken them up, and carted them to Rosetta to use as fill for the walls. 

Plunder is when you overrun the enemy's camp and carry off their pay chests. Plunder is when you storm a town and go house to house ransacking them for gold and jewels. Plunder is not picking up a slab of stone lying in the sand. If what the French did was plunder then every kid who ever picked a seashell up off a beach on vacation in a foreign country is guilty of plundering. In order to plunder something, the person you're taking it from actually has to consider it valuable. 

But you use the word plunder, because if you described what the French actually did at Rosetta then no one would agree with you.

>The ruler was a TEN YEAR OLD BOY and he ""gave"" the diamond to the English in exchange for the release OF HIS MOTHER who was being held hostage by the English at the time.

Actually, the treaty was negotiated by one of the Sikh commanders; the ten year old boy's signature was merely a formality. The transfer of the diamond had nothing to do with the young Maharaja's mother; no terms are specified in the treaty, but it was probably given up to secure British protection for the Maharaja. Half the Sikh court had been assassinated in internal power struggles and the child Maharaja was probably safer in the care of the British than anywhere else anyway. He was raised as a British gentleman and from the age of 16  onwards lived in Britain. Queen Victoria was godmother to his children.

I mean, there's people who think exactly this, and the existence of various cultural artifacts in territories controlled by other religious powers is a cause of upset for many people. Just look at Jerusalem.

People are far more upset about things that are part of modern-day cultures and religions because they are much more relevant to their modern-day culture.

Like, if Saudi Arabia fell, and was replaced by a new culture with a new religion, a lot of Muslims would be pissed that Mecca was no longer in the hands of Muslims and that the old religious rules no longer applied there.

Wow such reaching. In your original comment, you said ""Arabs have a tendency to destroy cultural artifacts over blasphemy."" Yet surely you must realize that in any monotheist religion there's a big difference between the sin of blaspheming God and the sin of idolatry. You can compare the Wikipedia articles on Islam and Blasphemy and on Shirk to educate yourself.

Also, Islam was formed when the only other Arab monotheists were Christians and took a lot of inspiration from them. And you can see how often the word occurs in any English language history on Mohamed or Mecca."

Stolen artifacts do not belong in museums. There is a presumption that most cultural artifacts that are removed from their geographic context are stolen or mostly stolen, and this isn't true. Legal acquisition is far more common than people assume.

The conclusion from my class is ""if there is no legacy of government or people from both when the artifact was created and when it was transported, to whom should it be returned? Do we return all Chinese artifacts to the PRC or ROC? Do we return all Ottoman artifacts to turkey or the countries that they came from?"

Barely.  The 1687 siege by the Venetians almost completely destroyed the whole flipping place.  That's why it's such a disaster zone and has taken so long to restore with so many major portions of structure having to be put in as modern recreations.

And would they have survived the seiges during the Greek War of Independence between 1821 and 1827?

And from what I see, the air polution was so bad in Athens that as recently as the 90's the greeks themselves had to remove all the remaining marbles, lest they be destroyed further by the elements:

> Air pollution and acid rain have damaged the marble and stonework.[79] The last remaining slabs from the western section of the Parthenon frieze were removed from the monument in 1993 for fear of further damage.

Firstly no the Macedonians were not Greek in the same way modern Greeks are, the same way the Celts were not English. There is a very clear line of conquest and replacement, they aren’t the same peoples. Modern Greeks are no descendants of them, culturally or ethnically. Second, the marbles were stolen from the Ottomans, the modern Greek people held no ownership over anything at the time, if the Greeks can claim ownership of the artefacts from cultures they conquered, can the Turks not do the same? What greater claim do the Greeks have exactly? Other than that they want them.

Nothing gives Elgin or the British greater claim. The British and the Greeks and the Turks can all claim right, the former by ownership and the latter by conquest. But as the British have them and nobody has any greater claim, there is no good reason to change that ownership."

And modern levantines share genetics with modern europeans, because of generations of inter-marriages under the Roman Empire, Greek empire, and before then Mediterranean trade networks, all long before Arabs conquered the region.

Citation please? And still you've failed to provide concrete evidence of an Egyptian Muslim destroying an ancient Egyptian artifact for idolatry. Even if Mohammad were a highway robber, arguing that fact to be evidence that the looters were religious zealots would be like saying an English Anglican who loots a Spanish-owned shop must've been motivated by anti-Spanish bias because of the war waged by Henry VIII.

>Medina was a Jewish city when Mohammad moved there

The existence of Arab Jewish tribes still does not contribute to a reasoned argument for your scoffing at my use of the English word ""pagan"" to describe the indigenous polytheism of the Arab world. Show me evidence that best practice among historians and other academics involves avoiding the word ""pagan"" in this context.

And still your incorrect use of ""blasphemy"" shows unfamiliarity with basic religious terms. No Christian or Muslim or Jew would ever accuse the ancient Egyptians of blasphemy against Yahweh for practicing Egyptian religion. Also anyone remotely familiar with modern Egyptian society and economy would know just how much they value their nation's antiquities. I suspect your comment comes from a lazy stereotyping of Muslims based off the actions of the Taliban or ISIS."

Even the argument of forced consent often falls apart because so many things were acquired from dealers (who later did violate domestic and international law) or sometimes straight up given away by governments as political gifts, or were allowed to be taken. 

As an example of the latter, I'll point to what happened with the Memnon Head. When Giovanni Belzoni asked the Ottoman government if they could take the statues back to England, and the Ottoman government agreed because they had no desire to have polytheistic idols represented in monuments in their land. Whether or not Ottoman power in Egypt legitimately is a fair question, but so is the question of cultural continuity of people living in Egypt at that time and now, in regards to who should get to keep the artifact."

[https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2013/10/14/egypts-disappearing-ancient-artifacts/](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2013/10/14/egypts-disappearing-ancient-artifacts/)

With Egypt specifically, half the problem is that the country is particularly unstable, *and* theft happens *precisely* b/c of the financial value of many of those artifacts.

The other problem that Egypt *potentially* has is the country is muslim, and *hardline* extremist muslims have, not infrequently, gone out of their way to *intentionally* destroy historical artifacts (and particularly religious ones), b/c some of them take the stupid (and destructive) idolatry clause of the Torah very, *very* seriously.

*Christians* already went through their own stupid / destructive phases (see how eg. almost all mesoamerican writings were intentionally destroyed by the Spanish b/c they thought they were heretical), but are thankfully past that point. Muslims, however, are not, and if anything the idiotic muslim fundamentalist revival of the 20th / 21st century is massively more backwards than the *historical* culture / religion that it's supposedly reviving. Although even the fairly tolerant islamic empires were generally *not* *at all interested* in the cultural / religious / historical value of ancient Egyptian artifacts, and it was largely *the British and French*, *not* the native Egyptians, who kickstarted archeology *for historical research and preservation* (not just to make a quick buck), in the first place. *Before that* note that egyptian tomb robbers were just raiding tombs for *valuable* (ie. gold) artifacts, and were looting, grinding up, and selling the entombed as ""mummy powder"", a magical / snake oil cure-all, for chrissake.

Anyways, given all of the above, there's maybe more than a few reasons to think twice about whether the British museum should just give back the Egyptians all of their artifacts. History is... complicated, and if nothing else the UK is a fairly *safe* place to securely store historical artifacts for the foreseeable future, or at least absent something like a global thermonuclear conflict or w/e."

>The International Council of Museums' current definition of a museum (adopted in 2022): ""A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage. Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster diversity and sustainability. **They operate and communicate ethically, professionally and with the participation of communities, offering varied experiences for education, enjoyment, reflection and knowledge sharing.""**"

The marbles were taken from the Ottomans, yes, but the marbles were not the Ottomans’ to give away. If i take your TV, hold onto it for 20 years, then give it to my friend, does that mean I rightfully had possession of it to gift it away? Obviously not.

You are severely underestimating the cultural proximity of ancient Macedon to the rest of Greece. Yes, there were feuds between city states like Athens and Sparta. Yes, Macedon was “further away”, both geographically and culturally. However, Macedon was still unambiguously part of the same cultural landscape.

In all fairness, lots of people who want to discuss the current events in geopolitics genuinely don't know enough history behind these events, and only echo the argument of their country's most popular media.

And alot of Egyptians today do not know the history of the ancient Egyptians.  They don't know of its relation to modern European nations, their contributions to western civilization or that western europeans are also descendants of the ancient Egyptians.

You'd think that the Rosetta Stone, where half it's contents is written in Ancient Greek, and the other half in Egyptian hieroglyphs, would make them understand why such an artifact isn't just important to European scholars, but also belongs with Western nations rather that a culturally Arab-Islamic country that has no lineage to either ancient Greece, or ancient Egypt.

It was only 10 years ago when huge numbers of Egyptian artifacts were stolen by looters and others during the regime change of the Arab Spring. Only a few months ago I was wandering a fascinating exhibit on the Assyrians, one of the very first civilisations in the entire world, that existed in what is now Iran. The site that they were taken from *was* destroyed by ISIS using explosives, because it conflicted with their religious beliefs for their country to have such deep and rich history before Islam. I can still see now in my mind's eye the detailed, careful engravings of Assyrian Kings, covered with cuneform spellwork and blessings, ancient boasts and stylised bragging. If it was back in Iran, it *would* have been reduced to shattered rubble.

The underlying truth of it means that in order to argue against it you have to take a stance of ""Okay, fine. The artefacts will have a higher chance of being stolen or destroyed, but they should go back to Egypt anyway because x, y, z."""

Egypt Wants Its Rosetta Stone Back From the British Museum,redhatGizmo,https://gizmodo.com/egypt-wants-its-rosetta-stone-back-1849626582,Lobster_fest,"I've actually fully typed out and deleted 3 separate comments going through as much context for the Elgin Marbles that I can conjure from memory, but I've been unsatisfied with each one. I guess I'll give it another go.

The entire thing hinges on the second firmen. Elgin and his men claim that there was a second firmen signed by the Ottoman governor which allowed for the expansion of their dig at the acropolis to the Parthenon itself. At the time, the Parthenon was in a state of total disrepair and decay, due to its changing uses which ended with it being an Ottoman fort. When Elgin arrived in Greece, he wanted to observe the marbles, and more specifically wanted to take plaster casts of the marbles. The Ottoman governor resisted this, but not on any cultural or historic grounds.

Supposedly, the second firmen changed the scope of Elgins operation to include working directly on the parthenon itself. The mayor of Athens at the time was assigned directly by the Ottoman governor to oversee Elgin's operation, and was given a conflicting description of what Elgin was allowed to do. As far as I am aware, we do not know for certain either what the Ottoman Mayor was told, or what the 2nd firmen said specifically when it came to what *specifically* Elgin was allowed to do. What we do know, from my understanding, is that it didn't say for certain that Elgin could take the metopes, triglyphs, and frescoes from the Parthenon, but it also didn't say for certain that he couldn't. The second firmen was destroyed in a fire.

The evidence for the contents of the second firmen comes from when Elgin attempted to make his plaster casts of the marbles, but was running into issues getting approval for both the workers to operate on the Parthenon and the scaffolding required. Eventually, it was suggested by one of Elgins men, a priest, that they simply take the originals. Herein lies more confusion. The mayor of Athens allowed them to take the marbles.

Was the mayor intimidated or coerced? The expedition was not military in nature, so at the very least he wasn't held at gun point. The Ottoman governor was furious, but seemingly not at the fact that the marbles were taken, but that they had violated the firmen. As mentioned above, we don't know what it said for certain, and we don't know what it did or didn't allow for.

I am still not quite sure if I consider the marbles to be stolen or not. They're certainly not military plunder, but like I said, it's a very, very nuanced situation."
Egypt Wants Its Rosetta Stone Back From the British Museum,redhatGizmo,https://gizmodo.com/egypt-wants-its-rosetta-stone-back-1849626582,Lobster_fest,">When we say ""a king conquered a city"" is a thousand times more complicated than that, with hundreds of different actors involved. But it's easy enough to understand the point.

>Same with ""Elgin stole them""

This is not even close to the same scenario as that, but sure, go ahead.

The mayor of Athens is distinct from the city of Athens because the Mayor was a direct actor whereas the city which housed the Parthenon had pillaged its marble for use in construction for hundreds of years.

The Ottoman empire is distinct from the governor because they had absolutely zero interest in the marbles unlike the governor."

i've read from articles over the years that the practice was ongoing since the time of cleopatra with some records of mummy consumption occurring during her era (the pyramids already being an ancient wonder during her reign), this is not a recent endeavor from what i understand and was common not just in europe but all over the world and throughout multiple cultures, i believe it even occurred in places such as mongolia though i am not sure of the timeframe for that.

when it comes to mummy history we have to accept that because of the nature of the country of egypt, a fuck ton of information is lost, moreso than the more stabile countries to the west like britain and france, the references to corpse medicine are often sparse and a minor topic of discussion but here are a few references that [make a very clear link between 12th century beliefs and beliefs of the peoples from 1292-1077 BCE](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/mummies-and-the-usefulness-of-death#:~:text=Since%20the%2012th%20century%2C%20Europeans,had%20been%20mummified%20or%20not.)

**Your point 1.)**  It's complex to say who would be wrong/right.  Waterways, straights, canals used for international trade are all governed by pretty strict rules, even on sovereign territory.  Turkey for example,  isn't really allowed to block Russian merchant ships, despite siding with Ukraine in the war.  The Suez canal adds extra complexity thanks to the resolution of the Suez Crisis in the late 50's.  The Suez Canal Authority is legally not allowed to forbade any vessel entry, unless they are at a state of war with that nation. Violating that treaty can justifiably be treated as an act of aggression or even war resulting in justified military response. 


**Point 2)**  You're being weird again with the way you phrasing it.  There is no divine referee here, or ""Mommy Country"" to dictate what's ""allowed"".  Any country can sanction any other country, just like any country can treat an incoming sanction as a hostile act, or act of war.   It's not about the US being the only ones ""allowed"" (notably since many nations use sanctions), its morseo that the Americans have the ability to back up their sanctions when any escalation on the sanctioned party.  Does Egypt have that confidence when dealing with the US or UK?

**Point 3)** Weird again, this is the type of strategy that works like in a Bond film, but doesn't represent reality.

 a) No nation is going to really oppose American intervention, when Egypt was in violation of a treaty like this.  No nation wants to set the precedent where countries can block trade this way.  No ones allowed to do it, and that's the way most countries like it. No ones going to sit back and let Egypt set that precedent. 

 b) You pointed out that it's going to hurt other countries bottom line.  That's the quickest way to increase the international response and ensure that the Suez Canal is recognized as international territory. 

 c) Egypt would be bankrupting themselves over what? Egypt needs the income from the Suez canal, they benefit more then any other country on it's existance

d) it would take a lot less then a decade to reopen that canal, and I think the Americans actually might be able to strike quick enough to prevent any significant damage.  The amount of explosives and equipment Egypt would need to move their to do that? The Americans would know days before the project began, and again, would have an escalated response due to what it would perceive as a hostile action."

Anyone could be next, naturally. But it’s a moot point because you lack the capability of preventing the UK/US from using the canal. You just can’t back the threat. To take it a step further and threaten to destroy the canal? Well, then the entire world would liberate the canal from your oppression. It’s a ridiculous notion too, as to threaten to destroy it is silly when lacking the capability to do so before prevented.

￼Right, right, “it’s not fair, we should be allowed to do whatever the US does, who cares about treaties.” Hint: the world isn’t remotely fair. The US does what it’s able to back up. No one “allows” the US to do shit. Egypt is “allowed” to do whatever it can back up. Leveraging the canal in such a way is not among its capabilities."

And to do so would need to violate yet another treaty you can’t blame on anyone else? And that the world would be totally cool with Egypt breaking the nuclear proliferation treaty so that it could violate its trade agreements? Totes credible."

Sounds good. Let me know how holding the canal hostage via nuke in 50 years goes. That entire generation and a half later is totally gonna still be furious about the Rosetta Stone and, like you, think it’s worth getting glassed over. Good luck with that!"

Is using their territory useful? Yes. But we don’t need a nato member that’s engaged in a decade’s long ethnic cleansing campaign with a side of killing Armenians cause Turkey. Literally funded ISIS etc. But you do sound as delusional as Turkish nationalists though - I see where you’re getting your inspiration. Never mind Turkish economic and political issues. Real “let’s give up getting the f35 for an s400 tech transfer” energy on your end. 

You don’t seem to realize that Egypt will not be able to leverage the canal as long as there is as much of a power disparity as there is, and the US is progressing at a light year’s faster pace than Egypt. Wouldn’t at all be shocked if Egypt built a nuke in 50 years and had no viable way to use it apart from trying to physically smuggle it into their target country. It’s not like they’ve got shit for innovating missile (or anything) tech.

But shit, it is frankly delusional and naive as humanly possible to think Turkey would defect to Russia. Have you been living in a cave??"
