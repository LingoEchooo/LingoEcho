Did your immigrant parents happen to speak English to you at home? I'm an Anglophone but wanted my kids to have native French abilities too so I put them in the local French Lycee rather than a public french Canadian school. The Lycee teachers told us to never speak French to them because they'll learn my admittedly terrible Anglo-French accent. That got me thinking. My parents to this day do not speak in English to me. I know chinese Canadian kids like me that had parents that spoke English to them, thinking that it would be helpful. It wasn't. Not only did they not know how to speak Chinese, but their English had a funny accent. I just did accent oracle and it said I was native speaker."

I'm assuming it  has to do with the way you form sentence structures or emphasize certain words. 

I'm Mexican-American and it correctly identified me as a native speaker but it also gave me 19% Spanish influence, and 3% Russian influence. I was raised in the U.S and I learned English & Spanish at the same time. A lot of white americans assume that I don't speak Spanish. I will say that I 1000% have a deeper and more raspier speaking voice(less bright) than most Americans I've met and I do tend to emphasize certain words in my day to day speech. I think it's amazing it was able to catch that while still identifying me as a native speaker."

Accent training app BoldVoice ,mohpit,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/1ftbyvq/accent_training_app_boldvoice/,Cultural_Lynx2253,"I used it for roughly 30 minutes a day for a week now. I think its quite good for improving my pronunciation. The tutorials are well made and the exercises feel mostly appropriate for my level. There are two big thinks that I really dislike though:


1. The voice detection model can be really picky about your intonation. Sometimes you have to hit just the right pitch to get a full pass ‚Äì which doesn't really reflect and respect the variance natural speech. There are also quite a lot of false positives for certain tones on certain words sometimes.
My educated guess is that this AI model was trained on rather homogenous data and that my voice profile doesn't really fit the vectors that well.


2. The ""affordable"" plan doesn't include all the AI chat features. You have to pay quite a bit extra for all the roleplay stuff and the opportunity of free voice interaction with a bot.


I also compared BoldVoice to Elsa and think that that BV feels better designed overall. Its linguistic tutorials are more professional and are supported with animations of how to position your tongue while speaking. Elsa just embeds a YouTube player that ... well, plays their YouTube tutorials. Meh. Feels a little cheaply made.


Elsa's AI model is waaaay less strict and gives me a pass with pretty much everything. Its ranking while learning specific words and tones is pretty loose, if you ask me. Not sure if that tightens over time as you rank up in the exercises. So far, however, after a few days, I think that it's quite the opposite of BV in terms of misspelling detection.


What I like about Elsa is their learning in sequences where a new word is added to the phrase every time you get a pass. I think that this type of learning is less frustrating and supports my personal pace and sense for the natural transitions between words/tones really well.


Other that that, I think that BoldVoice is better overall, though. If you don't notice too many false positives on your voice during trial I'd give it a recommendation.

I can confirm that the first few weeks are the most rewarding, with the learning curve becoming steeper and steeper after fixing the most common issues. I feel that my pronounciation has significantly improved but I still need practice in everyday communication with choesive sentences where everything blends together more naturally. BoldVoice is mostly based on single words. There are also some phrases and sentences here and there. There is also an AI chat feature. But it's limited to the overpriced premium pass and has the same technical limitations as the other exercises, namely the lack of precision in speech decetion on longer, more complex phrases and sentences.

The speech detection of BoldVoice has still some major issues. Certain sounds are persistently being misinterpreted by the language model and do not even match the voice samples provided in the app. The consistency can vary severly. You have to speak very loud and clear to minimize that. But there is always some error which gets very frustrating over time. I feel like their language detection model was trained on very limited data which urges the user to ""imitate"" the voice of the reference speaker here and there. There are also situations where the app wants you to overpronounce certain sounds like the R or the voiced (buzzing) S. Speaking like a normal person would do can lead the devaluation of your grade sometimes.

On the long term I feel like BoldVoice keeps repeating lessons that I already mastered or mostly mastered but that it fails to recognize since its voice rating is simply biased on certain sounds (like R or S, like mentioned above). I can repeat the speech scan to generate a new learning program. But that doesn't really make sense when the detection algorithm is only looking for words where I do not match the expected overpronounciation.  
There are still some issues in my pronounciation, of course. But I don't feel like the generated program is spot-on to help me to further improve on those issues. The program is somewhat random now, if you ask me.

Overall I think that the app has significant use in the first two months. It significantly improved my pronounciation. On the long term though I feel like I need more natural conversation instead of only words or phrases. Also, when the progress rises to a certain level, the lessons and especially the AI are simply unable to cover your individual needs. Language as a whole is still too complex to cramp it into just one app that covers every aspect of how we speak.

I would still recommend BoldVoice for starters who want to fix common issues in their pronounciation. But I would not recommend using it more than say 3 months."

I think its because your speech is too high up in your mouth and you speak inwards rather than outwards. And it can give off that slight -urrurr sound. Try holding your hand in front of your mouth (20 cm or so) and get your breath to hit your hand while speaking. 
Your r is almost all the way back in your palette but it should be almost right behind your teeth. Try to relax your jaws and focus on pronouncing your constants more clearly as well, and moving your mouth less.

As a huge fan of Bob Odenkirk for Mr. Show and a huge The Office fan, I still do not think Odenkirk would have made a good Michael Scott. 

Bob Odenkirk's wheelhouse for comedic characters doesn't include the likes of Michael Scott, a buffoon of legendary proportions who though selfish is increasingly good-natured and well-intentioned despite being a walking disaster.  Bob Odenkirk is great at playing slimeballs, grimy weirdos, and awkward characters whose awkwardness is not akin to Michael Scott's endlessly watchable awkwardness. His straight comedy awkward characters work extremely well in short-form, like sketch comedy. To see him try to embody a character like Michael Scott, with his own sensibility, would have quickly become grating and stale, imo"

For example, it's extremely common in scifi for the many-worlds theory of quantum mechanics to be interpreted along the lines of ""every time we make a choice, a new timeline branches off for every other choice we could've made"", even though that's not what the actual theory says at all. These theories don't specifically have anything to do with human choice.

Multiverse theories also typically don't imply that *all conceivable possibilities* exist, even if they imply that infinitely many possibilities exist. {2, 4, 6, 8, ... } is an infinite list of numbers, but there are infinitely many conceivable numbers *not* in that list too.

There is still drift in the multiverse theory. So while each outcome is possible and each universe is minorly different as these differences add up the universe is substantially changed. So in a universe where you died of a brain aneurysm a few seconds ago is most likely a universe where you don't actually exist because a different combination of DNA came together when you were born. So in the universe, you are not you.

That's assuming that in this Universe you do not die of a brain aneurysm at any point and don't die at all for quite some time.

That's my general understanding, but I could be wrong. I think the only way to test it was to have some sort of suicide method setup that can only be triggered by random decay of radioactive materials. You would set it up in such a way that it would have a very high probability of going off, but because of the truly random chance that it would never go off, you would actually never experience it going off as your consciousness would continue in every universe where the small random chance was the outcome. If the theory is wrong though it would go off pretty quickly and you would just die."
