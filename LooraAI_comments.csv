Extra practice for students,cjmdlkr1123,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineESLTeaching/comments/1iczygb/extra_practice_for_students/,dengue666,"I just found out about this app called ELSA, it's an AI that helps with conversation and other things. I saw the paid version and it's very complete, it gives you a review of every single aspect of your speaking, it's kinda freaky actually! The free version has less functions but I bet it's good aswell. In fact, I think it's a good tool for teachers to keep up with learning and always improving."
