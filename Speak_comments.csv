If you really want to start off speaking I would recommend pimsleur which focuses on pronunciation and gives you prompts to speak.  I would also recommend language transfer
Thoughts on Speak.com or its app?,insert_dumb_comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dn01uv/thoughts_on_speakcom_or_its_app/,GeorgeTheFunnyOne,I heard about them last year. They are kind of expensive. Speak is being funded in part from OpenAI. It will be interesting to see how (if at all) the language learning market.
Thoughts on Speak.com or its app?,insert_dumb_comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dn01uv/thoughts_on_speakcom_or_its_app/,Competitive_Flow231,"Speak is a good app and Connor, one of the founders is a very nice guy! They focus a lot on pronunciation and have a lot of videos of real people showing you have to pronounce different words and expressions. To me, it sometimes feels a bit dumbed down and too easy since in one lesson you just learn very few words.  
So I could see how someone gets bored quickly.

From what you're saying it sounds like you already have the vocabulary but not yet the speed to put the sentences together quickly enough. I'm building an app that might have the opposite problem of speak, which is that we put people in the situations they would face in the real world and thus are more challenging. So you're having conversations with an AI and get corrections and feedback on every message you send. [Speak](http://speak.com) also has that to some extent but when I tried it I really felt a bit lost since I was unable to get enough help during the conversations.

Since speak has a lot of videos of actual people saying different words the cost of their app is pretty high and if you want the AI features on top the prices go into the stratosphere. But hey if they are worth that much to you go get it. Prices on my app, Univerbal are significantly lower...but we also offer a different product and don't have any videos. So it really comes down to what you want to learn.

If you want to see and listen to **people pronounce different words and expressions**, then speak is probably the better option if you can afford it. If you want to **gain confidence and fluency in conversations** to prepare you for speaking to a native speaker then maybe you'll like **Univerbal**.

(I already mentioned it in the post, but here again: I'm one of the founders of [Univerbal](http://univerbal.app))"

It's more so how to string together sentences and that's all I'm really focused on getting right. The vocab and all I know I can get through practice via Anki. Have you happened to use any AI tutors?

For example: I can introduce myself. Afterwards, you can practice this ""skill"" in a conversation or if you don't yet feel like you're ready you can do a ""tutor session"" where you get some explanations and exercises from your AI tutor.

I'm an English teacher, and from what my students have said, the Speak app is pretty good for conversation practice. With the premium version, you can practice as much as you want, which is awesome. The other top picks are ChatterFox and ELSA Speak. I'd recommend trying out different tools to see which one clicks for you. Everyone's different, so what works for one person might not work for another. Good luck finding the best fit for you!"

yes I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just really really new, the premium price is sooo expensive but honestly it has felt the most effective so far. And particularly good because I could ask the AI to even make a lessen using the vos form that‚Äôs used in Argentina and it was really specific to that region. 
I really want to know if there is a lot more content or if the lessons dwindle.

I‚Äôm inclined to think she might be pretty genuine, though maybe I‚Äôm just gullible. 
I don‚Äôt see sex work as much different from other work these days. She‚Äôs offering a service for a rate. 
It‚Äôs an up front offer that can be politely declined if not wanted. Making fun of someone for what they do to earn money, and shaming people who do sex work could be seen as being a bit old fashioned. 
Ok, it might be problematic that the offer came when she had already made a connection on a different basis. But she was under no obligation to continue with the existing arrangement, and could just have easily said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out thanks, see you.‚Äù without being seen as problematic."

Him thinking it's just a one night stand he agreed. 

Tomorrow morning she demanded 3K USD. I've grown up in this culture, so much I can sniff a prostitute within 2 seconds of looking at their profile or talking to them. 

1) Vulgar expression- prostitute have no fear of saying vulgar expression compared to an average/normal woman. Normal woman rarely say vulgar expression with ease. 

2) if she's greeted by 1/2 individuals within an hour of meeting. 

3) Dressing- they're called thigh vendors for a reason.

4) It's easy to sleep with her, - yeah because if you don't sleep with her, she has no basis to cash out. 

5) Fancy hotel pics- when you finally meet up, she doesn't have any money. 

6)Before she sleeps, she tries to make sure all her clothes are neat, and well packed. She doesn't want to look dirty in the morning. 

I could go on and on on on. But I've been subjected to this culture, sometimes as a willing participant and more often not a willing participant

So not at all surprising the language would be passed down and remain prevalent in the area.

Similar happened with French speakers in Louisiana. That side of my family started arriving in la Louisiane ~1750 (when it was still a French territory). So my ancestors on that side spoke almost exclusively French until the 1900s when school became compulsory and children were beat if they did not speak English. I'm sure a similar process of forced assimilation occurred among Spanish speakers in the Southwest after Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico were annexed... And certainly occurred - with even greater intensity and scope - among Native peoples.

tl;dr: the US has always been a multilingual nation, no matter how much white supremacists wish it weren't so."

At the regional level, we have hundreds of languages, if not thousands but they aren't recognized as Official Languages. The state governments use the local language for everything, even official paperwork, making it easy for the common man to get information.

First of all, thanks for informing players of the issue. We were first informed about this at 8:08am PST. Since then our team has developed an internal safety check for external links to make this doesn‚Äôt happen again.

Now, I'm sure most of you savvy folks know this, but it's worth noting that we don't have direct control over the type of Ads that Google chooses to display on Blitz. That means this sort of issue could technically crop up on any ‚Äúalternative‚Äù site that has ads. Still, it's our job to provide a secure, enjoyable environment for you, and we won't stop working to enhance our safeguards and user experience.

So, huge thanks again for looking out for one another and keeping the community safe. Keep that feedback coming and don't hesitate to flag up any potential issues.

Stay safe and game on,
Andy"

""It has nothing to do with Blitz, the ads are served by Google, and they do a shit job at moderating""

I work at a large online bank, and google constantly approves fake phone number ads for our site, which leads to people getting scammed by criminals pretending to be us. It shows up on Google as the #1 result, as it's an ad..

Google also had a huge issue with fake OBS/Afterburner download links being ads when you search for OBS, clicking it puts a cryptominer/redline stealer at best, and a  ransomware at worst on your machine.

Like no one blames OBS/Afterburner when google approves malware ads in their search results, and Blitz shouldnt be blamed here at all either."

Still, it's our job to provide a secure, enjoyable environment for you, and we won't stop working to enhance our safeguards and user experience. 

There is a huge difference between a giant fake download button appearing on a shady webpage than a native app opening an URL without any user interaction simply because you served the ad. 

Plus, what you said *is* a common knowledge for ""most of you savvy folks"", then how come Blitz never had any safe check, which you conveniently able to implement today in merely five hours?"

Obviously they are to blame, but the majority of reactions here are unwarranted in their severity.  Even stranger is where in my comment you found me directly defending and absolving Blitz for this bug?

A better comparison is if you manually made the bracelet and asked 500 dollars for it. And that would be totally fine though.

I'm D4 (peaked D2), but I have actual strategy knowledge and would not coach for a cheap price if anyone asked me to do so. It would be pretty expensive. I don't have any mechanics and I'm ahead of almost 99% ranked playerbase relying only in my knowledge.

If he lied about being challenger, yeah, this does make him a scammer. But as far as I know, he didn't lied. Just overestimated his feat to promote his coaching, which is not different from things we see everywhere. At best he didn't mention that he hit challenger years ago, but he's a coach? lol. You don't have to be GM to have knowledge enough to be a top coach, let alone Challenger. So who (outside Reddit) cares to when he hit challenger?"

I don't think he lies about his coaching expertise in a meaningful way, that is incredibly hard to quantify and 99.9% of his customers are his viewers anyway and very clearly know what they are getting.

If you mean his rank: well right now it is totally fine. It says ""neace or one of our challenger coaches"", you get to that point of the page by clicking ""book now!"" under ""get coaching from one of our challenger coaches"" or something like that.

Phrasing is slightly off, but if that is what you want to die on idk what to tell you.

And there also just isn't any clear cut way of how it has to be done. Some title people are fine with sticking for life (worldchampion), while they complain about others. And what constitutes a Challenger player? Finishing a season in challenger? Hitting it once for a day and then never again?

then i could pretty easily say an opponent near 200hp and 100 armor would need 400 damage from my Q to kill.


if i had an app that did that math for me, any reasonable person would say it's unfair.

edit- 

loosely related reference, for TFT there was a twitch extension that tracked your opponents boards, [which was disabled](https://www.metatft.com/twitch-extension) as it could be used indirectly as a scouting tool (meaning it could be used to have an easy overview of your opponents boards without having to cycle through them)

Yes, it can be argued that we shouldn't give money to riot games because of how they treat women. But riot did not lie about the product they are selling to you. You are buying a skin, and you are getting a skin.

 However, as much as you seem to want to write it off as ""no big deal"", lying about your rank, as a person giving coaching services, is fundamentally lying about the product you are giving to customers. If a customer is spending money for grandmasters coaching, and they receive masters coaching, then the customer is being scammed. They did not get the product they paid for."

A Shurrelyas plus an Ardent Censer is only going to cost ~5000g, but Infinity Edge and Shieldbow are going to cost more like ~6500g. That'd easy with support items. But then consider you often have two different classes playing in the same lane.

Having their total effective gold - meaning that it is not keeping track of unspent gold - allows you to quickly see who is further ahead and by how much. Most critically, it shows the gold difference between the entire teams. Blitz gives you a little blue/red arrow and shows the difference in gold between the two teams, which is an extremely useful tool for determining who will win a teamfight.

The important part is that it is a tool of convenience. Any player *could* do the math on their own, but a gold overlay allows them to not expend more energy than is needed. It's about how you use the numbers to guide your gameplay."

>El-Shabab was reported to the authorities via Kollona Amn, a mobile app available to download from the Apple App store and the Google Play store, which empowers ordinary citizens to snitch on their compatriots.¬†

>The Saudi regime has often encouraged citizens to inform on one another, but Kollona Amn, launched by the Saudi interior ministry in 2017, has made it possible to report comments critical of the regime or behavior deemed offensive by the conservative theocracy with a few clicks. Legal-rights activists say that over the past few years, they've witnessed a dramatic rise in court cases that reference the app, as the country's current leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ‚Äî widely known by his acronym MBS ‚Äî expands the use of technology to surveil, intimidate, and control its citizens at home and abroad.

Im from Kuwait which is actually the most relaxed in the region in terms of freedom of expression (we have a parliament) yet we cannot even criticize the Saudi government without going to jail if we want to.

1. Report him to the app.

2. Report him to the police. You have enough to get a no-contact order, and you could possibly get a protection order as well. The police report will also provide a paper trail to allow you to press charges if he keeps after you. 

3. Notify your apartment building/landlord/apartment manager about him. This might sound like overkill but it is not. You can make a printoff with his profile pic, and label it ""DO NOT ALLOW INTO BUILDING - THREATENED RESIDENTS""

Also, **never apologize to men online**. It makes them feel justified for anything they decide to do or say later. ""She apologized, because she knows she was wrong!"" You weren't wrong.

Dating apps are about throwing out a WIDE net to catch fish to sort through and choose a good one.

I've moved states and blocked multiple numbers and social media accounts since then. He's still showing up. 

Save the screenshots, communicate one final time to express that you don't want him contacting you so that your bottom is covered legally in case you need a restraining order. When he inevitably continues to harass you, save those screenshots but do not reply.

Explicitly telling him you want him to stop contacting you will make getting a restraining order easier."

edit: a guy harassed me for 24 hrs straight because i don't want to meet up after only having talked for less than a week and i had responsibilities that weekend. 

he made new accounts, harrassing me. hurling exact same insults. 

later tried to catfish me but i recognized his speech behavior. and he would slip up and talk to me in this tone like we knew each other outside of this new chat.

i called him out and he went absolutely psycho. he stated claiming he knew where i lived and worked.  sent me map screenshots and stuff. he had been RESEARCHING me. or at least trying to. all his conclusions were wrong

edit: oh and i forgot the most important part.  what actually set him off was me telling him AND reiterating that i would not be having sex with him when we met up.

i had to reiterate because he kept saying ""sure. but whatever happens, happens"" and kept talking about our future meetup as though we were going to have sex. 

i really laid down the law and he flipped his shit and the harassment started from there and he accused me of never even wanting to meet up and called me a slut because that somehow adds up"

Like, did this guy have a right to be upset (obviously he has no right to respond the way he did but that's not the question). I kind of think what OP did was really shitty. You don't set up dates with people and then cancel them because you found a stronger connection with someone else. What was the point of sharing that information? Also, it's not nice to make plans with someone and then you don't even cancel or reschedule (you technically did cancel but he had to ask you first. Why hadn't you already contacted him?). Also, how did you know that the person you were meeting instead was even going to work out? Maybe you had a better connection with him but what if it went sideways in person (assuming you hadn't met him already)?

Also, she then says it's basically a better fit because of convenience? Lol are you serious OP? ""You know hunny, I knew from the moment that you were only 15 mins away from my house that you were the love of my life"""

I would be absolutely terrified; please take care of yourself. Please document everything, including his profile, and email them to yourself so that they're time stamped. I know it is difficult and you don't want to see his crazy shit, but please unblock him. 

I would honestly report him to the police; these texts are really unhinged and scary. Please don't be afraid to cry and let the police know how scared and upset you are- ask for a female cop if you feel more comfortable. Anything it takes to be taken seriously. 

If you send me his phone numbers, I would be glad to help you try to find his full legal name. From there, (I see 239 area code - I'm from there) you can use Lee County Property lookup as well as Lee Sheriff to find out his known addresses and criminal record, so that you have the appropriate info to get him served with a protective order.

Look into seeing if your area has an ""Are we dating the same man, (city)?"" Facebook group and post these screenshots there so that other women are aware and can avoid interacting with him on dating apps."

I don't think the police is going to do anything, but it is smart to report it anyway. Because if he does show up at your door, they have some information. And if he wants to hurt you, you can say you already talked to the police so they'll definitely find him if he tries anything.

Also inform other people in your life. Show them pictures of what he looks like.

This guy is definitely not single by choice or because he just got out of a loving relationship. There's definitely another reason he's 37 and single."

\-Report him to the police, if nothing else this will at least start a paper trail that you will WISH you had if this gets any worse especially if he has a digital history of using dating apps in this manner.  
\-Re download the damn app, and report him- they can use the trail of your in-app messages giving out numbers + your texts to prove that this person isn't safe to be on their dating app. If it's too much trouble to spend a few minutes re-downloading the app and making sure you report this properly then I don't know what to say to you. That sort of behaviour is likely why he was ever able to match with you in the first place, so just report him to the damn app and let them know you reached out to the police about this man.

From that point on? Someone needs to know where you are at all times, don't leave spare keys outside of your house because someone could come snooping outside and find them, don't answer your front door without checking out of a window to see who it is, don't take the same routes to/from work or other activities. Get a ring doorbell.

Hopefully, he's just crazy and lazy- but that's a 50/50 you might not want to take so I would just handle this now before it gets worse.  People love to act like nothing will ever happen, but when someone is talking like this it's a roll of the dice. Either they do something or they don't, and as the person who could be harmed by those choices you should be making some decisions of your own that protect yourself, your family, and the other women on that app.

NOR, when someone threatens you- believe them. Don't just hide your head in the sand."

One guy, I went to lunch at a restaurant by myself while out running errands.

Control your instinct to inform guys that they have been passed over for another male, as it is literally their sole (subconscious instinctive) purpose in life for that NOT to happen by any means necessary so they can breed. Some guys have this instinct too strongly/defectively and will attack the pussy... to keep the pussy. It sounds stupid, and it is, but it happens.

And GUYS!!!! What the FUCK?!?!?!?! Do you WANT to be somebody's BITCH in prison? Because this right here is how you wake up getting impregnated by another man in prison. CONTROL YOURSELVES. Never tell a woman how you feel, IT ALWAYS SOUNDS CREEPY. Just trust me.

There is ALWAYS another man trying to horn in on the woman you're talking to. EVERY SINGLE TIME. At least 100 of them actually. You are NOT the only guy who thinks she's ""cute"". Everywhere a woman goes she gets asked if shes got a bf, asked for her number, asked for the pussy outright. Everyday. All day long. Its difficult for some men to conceive this because its so different from our experience, but its the truth. If you lose your shot at one, keep moving. Don't you fucking cry about it. MAN UP. Ask another. And another. And another. And be cool with her if she rejects you. Make her laugh before that last goodbye. She might turn right back around and sit on your face that same night, YOU NEVER KNOW."

First of all- that message is from him. 

Second of all- that guy is a psycho .. block him on everything. Change your number if you can. 

Depending on what details he has- I would file a police report about the threat. Just to have it on file. They won‚Äôt do anything but you can also get a restraining order if you have the police report filed on the threat - if his behavior escalates. No police report ? No proof. 

Get the TRO If he can‚Äôt stop. But do NOT be afraid of this guy. Worst thing you can do. See the game and rise above it. You get afraid of him- he gets more powerful. See him for what he is- he wants power over you‚Ä¶ so he is trying to scare you. The best thing for him is for you to get scared of him.. that‚Äôs what he wants. 



And then move on. Be so glad you missed that guy."

So Gross. His behavior is scary.

This is NOT at all a reason for him to act like this, but I will say just for future (when dealing with a NORMAL  human being), even if you are talking to multiple guys in an app, I'd at least be mindful to cancel early on. It sounded like he was following up when you knew earlier on you wouldn't be going on a date because you found someone else. That's alright and all, but everyone has gotten used to using ""busy"" and forgetting. I would just plan and speak to the max number of people I can handle remembering plans with, not so many where I forgot to follow up with folks. If my life is that busy, then I'm off the apps until I'm more freed up. Again, this is for NORMAL situations, NOT this one,  but I'm sure we've all been on the receiving end of a ""busy"" that it gets old.  Just my 2 cents before everyone comes for me.

He was her fall back and waited til last second to cancel.  There are only 52 weekends a year and she tied this dude up for no reason.

There's a reason girls his age don't date him. 

I found insulting them back works wonders tbh like ""wow I see why your wife left you"" or ""huh, I figured out why you go for younger girls. Women your age see how pathetic you are"" 

They'll reply with a generic insult but then they leave you alone knowing you can't be insulted or manipulated. 

Whenever they send a message I reply with something insulting them like ""you get that hairline fixed?"" Or ""why is someone with teeth that looks like they eat gravel speaking to me?"" 

Once a guy I spoke to for 3 days stalked me for 3 months and randomly messaged me asking to hangout to which I replied ""ew"". Never stalked or spoke to me again. 

I'd report him to the app and never move off app until you've met. It's easier to report that way since all the messages can be viewed on their end. 

Good luck OP. You did nothing wrong."

 I've learned from even dating a couple of those girls that usually when you're on a dating app it's not because you're looking for a date but it's because you want continuous connections with new people. Sometimes it's not necessarily sexual or anything like that, but just purely because they are social and like to be social butterflies. 



Having said all this it should not matter if you are talking to other people and that somebody would get that mad they should have their account deleted immediately because they're going to put some girl in the future in danger, because I know I've had an ax that were still on dating apps while we were still dating. Some girls are just like this. Test the waters and see what fish you get that's the best!

It's guys like him that give most not all but probably most girls less of a reason to meet up with them if you've been talking through a dating app. What POS that's for damn sure. I can stand guys like him and definitely no way at all to treat someone especially a woman when they were being honest and sincere about telling them that they ended up having a better connection with someone else who happens to be more local to them. Id love to meet up with in person and beat his ass and teach dude some manners. Apparently his mother and grandmother didn't raise him right and teach him how to address woman without sounding like a total fucking ass clown. My apologies for the language but when I read stuff like this or witness it in public in person something takes over me mentally and I've always spoken very blunt on the topic. But to answer your initial question no you are not in anyway overreacting to this scumbag. And definitely save everything he's sent to you they are for sure threats and could get his ass in trouble that he probably doesn't even think he could get in trouble with. I swear some people just need to learn how to accept the good with the bad. You said it honestly in the nicest way possible and weren't rude at all. Even when he starting calling you names and shit. For being 37 he seems more like a child than a man. It's without a doubt a good thing you didn't follow through with a meet up with him. There's no telling what could've or would've happened had you and him met up a couple times and then you decided that it just wasn't a good fit for you guys. Which hey it happens and isn't always apparent on the first date when both people are most likely nervous and sometimes shy so they don't fully open up as to how they really are. Luckily for you this ass hat opened all the way up before even meeting up and checks all the boxes of stay the fuck away from him at all costs. Hope you stay safe and wish nothing but the best for you with the other guy you had a connection with. And again my apologies for the language and hope I didn't come across as a crazy guy either. I just have a very hard time staying silent when it comes to people mainly dudes acting like this towards a chick because she isn't attracted to them in any way or have similar likes and dislikes. There's 2 things that I can never keep my mouth shut about and that's a guy that talks to girl likes this or any man who thinks hitting a woman is ok. Because to me that's not a man hell it's not even boy, that to me is a POS that deserves his teeth knocked out and some lessons in manners with a hint of attitude adjustment sprinkled on top. See here I go again my apologies again. I hope you don't get the wrong impression im really not even a violent person it's only when I read this stuff that happens or witness it I swear. I'll stop talking now. Anywho hope you have a wonderful day and no lie stay safe out there!!"

People can just be utter dicks from the comfort of their living rooms. 

I would suggest making it super clear from the get go what your dating style is. Some people are comfortable meeting multiple people, while others prefer a one-at-a-time.  Either is absolutely fine and I find it very telling how he ramped up to slut shaming you when you were being courteous and in no way acting ""slurry."" He obviously has a lot of self esteem issues he needs to work on. I am sorry he is taking them out on you.

I said earlier I would suggest making your dating style clear, but honestly even that doesn't always work. I told a guy prior to a first meet that I take things slow and am not casual. Within half hour of that first walk and talk meet he said ""I hope you'll cancel Eharmony now."" Um...? Another claimed to be interested in something serious. I told him  I am not casual and don't race to the sack. After two brief 5 minute phone calls he fully expected our first meet would involve. a ""set your alarm for 10:30 so you can wake up and let me in. I'll pack an overnight."" He was going to drive from NJ to CT. When I declined he hung up on me and blocked me from the site. Like I would chase someone who wouldn't respect me enough to treat me as having a functioning brain and healthy boundaries!

So yeah. People come at dating sites with their own agenda firmly at front of mind and disregard the fact that they are dealing with fellow humans with their own needs and wishes. Being plowed through is horrendous. It accounts for why I only try to date for one month, once per year. I have been happily single for 7 years. It's definitely going to take way more than these types to get to me change that."

To echo the many voices on here I would also like to add that if you are concerned about reporting to the police by yourself I might recommend reaching out to a local woman's center or victim advocate agency who might be able to give you more localized resources.

Also:

- talking to multiple people at once on a dating app is normal and healthy. Both my husband and I did that when we met each other and we've been together for almost 11 years.

- reporting the app is very, very important.

- explicitly state that you do not want him to talk to you any more. At least in the US any communication after that is considered harassment and is prosecutable. Not sure how it is in the UK.

- for a while, at least until all this clears up, I'd let a few trusted friends know where you are going to be and when you go out. That way they can check in on you and make sure you got from point A to point B safely.

- for dates moving forward until this is resolved, go somewhere public and don't invite people home for a few.


Sending so much love and hoping this resolves with you on the winning end."

Text him back and say the other guy canceled, and you feel bad and would like to make it up to him.

Or, he will jump at the chance, in which case text him 30 minutes before you are supposed to meet and say, ""I am not coming, guess why?""

Dating is generally meant to court more than one person and find out which one better suits you. If you're on an app or even out in the wild, and you encounter someone and they are dating, don't assume, first of all that they want to date you. Second of all, don't assume that they are dating only you if they are dating you because dating does not mean exclusivity. It's quite the opposite. When both parties agree to make it exclusive, that's when it changes and now you have a courtship. It's honestly disgusting to see how people treat others based on their dating habits. Dating it's not just about one personü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è also that dude is scary. You definitely dodged a bullet OP. Got to see someone's true colours. 

( what happened to the days and which you found out that there was another interest in someone else and you worked harder to show your affections? You remember the radio playing outside the window, the bouquets of flowers at the doorstep or given during a date... That a slow burn to gain favor...

That is complete harassment and violation of privacy in several multifaceted ways. While I personally don't condone talking to multiple people at once due to being severely monogamous and find it incredibly rude/ unfair for how it may impact the person on the receiving end, this person is taking rejection far beyond any conceivable level of sanity.

My advice: 
‚Ä¢ report to the local authorities if you feel your life is in danger; this is obsessive, erratic, harassing behavior
‚Ä¢ file a restraining order if capable/ needed

While you may feel guilty for doing all of this when you yourself don't feel the situation is worth going through all the trouble/ effort, just remember:

1. You didn't ask for this; you tried handling things civilly 
2. It's your life being threatened/ put at risk
3. They're 37 years old and should know better by now how to treat another human being; they're a grown adult"

But I get where the frustration comes from. Iv had the ""btw I found someone else and we can't talk now more bye bye"" it really is a piss off and frustrating. Especially if you really have a good thing going. As well as backing out of a meet or hang up last minute is extra piss off. And kinda rude.

I'm not saying she Owes him because she doesn't at all. And I'm 100% not condoning what he said (with his behavior it's very good she didn't meet up with this guy as he seems very unsafe) but I do kinda understand the internal frustration and upsetness. As I have had that happen to me.

I just stepped away from wanting any connection with anyone after it happened to me as I didn't really trust anyone at that point for a while as I figured it would just happen again.

So yes VERY wrong way to outlet that upsetness/frustration. But I kinda do understand where it's coming from as no one wants to be told especially when your trying to build some sort of connection with someone ""hey I found someone new and a little bit closer we can't talk no more"" because at least in my experience it does make you feel like the person was just kinda using you to pass the time and that is a very bitter feeling.

So I'm not condoning his behavior but I understand where it's coming from if that makes any sense."

I can predict with high accuracy which ones will break character the moment they sense rejection.  They usually also feel the need to tell you they are nice guys, gentlemen, masculine, alpha, etc. 

KIND men don't need to tell you that they are kind. RESPECTFUL men don't label themselves. 
HIGH VALUE men don't shout it on their profiles. 

Almost 100% of the time you'll end up being called a fat fuck who was being given a chance. It's gaslighting abuse and the terrified call of a wounded animal.

Report him. Screenshot Everything in his profile. Reverse search his phone number and photos. Save all information you find, especially social media accounts and work information. Contact the app's customer service... don't just block him. Contact the police in your area and his.  If it's interstate, contact the FBI. HE'S MADE A PHYSICAL THREAT AGAINST YOU. If he doesn't try to harm you, he will someone else. 

If you live in an apartment, alert security. If you work somewhere that's accessible to the public, alert management, HR, and security.

If there‚Äôs ever a time for gray rocking it‚Äôs when someone gets verbally abusive, the first time. If your continued non-response leads to threats, you can say briefly: ‚ÄúI do not communicate with people who [swear at me, name call, whatever he‚Äôs doing with his words, just be descriptive]. Do not contact me again.‚Äù

Then don‚Äôt engage. If you want to keep the thread open in order to see if he threatens you, fine, but make sure it‚Äôs in a way that he doesn‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre getting his messages. So that to his experience, he might be blocked. He‚Äôll probably stop bothering you.

I‚Äôve found that no contact (no matter what crazy terrible shit they say) is the only way to get them to leave you alone - eventually. Sometimes it takes along time. As others have said, save everything. If he keeps harassing you file an order of protection or restraining order. Hope he doesn‚Äôt know your address or anything too close to it.

This guy sounds psychotic for sure though, you should definitley take him at face value and buy a gun (9mm minimum) and a box of Federal HST hollow points if you don't already have one and keep it on you in case he actually does try to locate you.
 If youre in the business of boning random people from the internet you would be foolish not to have one because if you dont need it this time you will eventually, theres hundreds of thousands of these guys out there. 
If people threaten you, *believe them* and make sure you're prepared to defend yourself.

I am glad you found a connection with someone else. Drop, Block, and Protect Yourself from that guy ASAP!

Call me old and a moron, but here is my opinion about ANY relationship, especially ones that are just beginning:

1. Each person should respect the other person and their decisions. Whether you just talk /text/ video / meet /  whatever once or 10,000 times, if the other person is abusive you are in danger. This serves as a good warning flag if early in your contact/relationship with them they get upset/angry. 

2. No always means No. (This should be #1)

3. If someone can't accept you for you, as you are, they are not a good person.

4. If the person makes fun of you, even if they apologise later and say ""only joking"" . They aren't. 

5. If you have to pay for everything, or most everything, that is a danger sign.

6. If they verbally, mentally, or physically abuse you (no matter how minor it seems) that is a danger sign. This is especially true If they come back after being abusive with gifts and/or declarations of live and ""sorry  it will never, ever happen again"". It WILL happen again.

7. If they are never wrong and/or can't take constructive criticism. Danger! Danger!

8. If they complain about what you eat, how much (or little) you eat, what you weigh, your clothes/appearance, etc. Danger!

9. If there are specific things you don't like they always seem to forget or ignore. (Ex: You don't like camping, but they always Book camping vacations. You are allergic to cats and ""whoops"" they just happened to find a little lost kitten on the way home. Aww, couldn't we just keep it and maybe you will grow out of your allergies.... pwease? (My sister's ex did this five times in their six year marriage. Not all were found kittens, some were ""Oh, __office mate__ brought her cat's litter to work and I know you are allergic, but I thought I would ask ... Oh, even a little stray kitten fur makes you do that. I'll change while you call the ambulance. )

10. Relationships are icing on life. Life is cake. If the person you are beginning ANY kind of contact/relationship with asks/tells/demands/requires you to spend less (or no)  time with friends, they are isolating you. This is bad. (OK, there are probably exceptions, like all of a person's friends are heroin addicts and they want to not be around that group, but are having trouble. )

11. Every relationship is give and take. 

12. They keep calling themselves a ""nice guy"" (and especially talk about how (other person)  didn't appreciate them like that or if only someone would give a nice guy li,like, him a chance.

13. (My wife of 33 years says to add this one): If the other person has kids and treats them like crap, there is no way you will be treated better. She met me and I was up front that I had a son. She met him on his 3rd birthday (one of the rare ones I got to see him). She said she liked that I wanted to be a part of my son's life. She had tried dating other guys before and was angry when after a few weeks or months, surprise he has a child(ren) he has never mentioned!

14. Don't lie. If the person you are going to be in a relationship with lies about small things, especially inconsequential things, then they will like about anything.

I hope this helps someone,

And OP ... you shouldn't feel bad if a 37m can't take ""sorry, not interested"" after speaking for a few days. He would ruin your life and it is all about him."

While it may or may not be a credible threat and the police are unlikely to do something at this stage, if there is at least something in the pipeline, a paper trail and this person does something else stupid they may very well put themselves away. 

Avoid responding to or engaging in any further communication with them.

Let your family and friends know about the current situation, you may want to stay with them for a while until the situation is resolved.

Upgrade your home security systems, if you don‚Äôt have a ring doorbell or something similar, get one, being caught on camera is a good deterrent, if you‚Äôre not sure your lock is sufficient then get a better one, even a door jammer would help, get some bright, outside lights, doesn‚Äôt have to be motion detected but that would be good, a big loud dog would be a great idea, Rottweiler or German Shepherd would be really good scary dogs to have."

**Screen shot everything, report to the police AND report them to the app.**

If you have ‚Äúunmatched‚Äù them on the app, you can still report someone!

If you have removed the app, the website will have the information to send, or you can redownload and send it on.

You will need to send the app/website:
His name and contact information: phone number and/or email.
Some apps may ask for screenshots of when the situation escalated.

***The app will be able to find that you matched with him, they will take this seriously.***

**Do NOT Block them on your phone.**
Simply mute the conversation, including all random texts, and continue to screen shot.
If any voicemails come in, record them.
Everything is evidence, and can show escalation!

***DO turn off your read receipts if you have them on.***
Do not give them the power of knowing you have read what they sent you.

If you have social media, and receive DMs of a threatening nature, screenshot and report. It could be them, a fake account or a friend of theirs. Don‚Äôt engage.


Ensure when you are out on a date a trusted friend or family member knows where you are.
I have a friend who I text the location and time of meeting, I also send a picture of the guy I am meeting to them.
I will text said friend a few minutes into the date to let them know I met the person (that yes they look like the picture from the app‚Ä¶ because I have dealt with someone who hadn‚Äôt before)  and what my potential plans are for the night.

I would rather be safe than sorry. And this friend agrees.

99% of the men I have dated have had no issue knowing I have someone I trust knowing where I am and who I am with. 
Some will even suggest me taking an on the spot selfie with them or of them to send on. These are green flag guys!

***Any many who gets mildly upset with this is a red flag and not worth your time.***


Please be safe!
Take this seriously."

I'm presuming you are in Britain, based on the word ""twat"", so it seems weird that he even has an American number (unless he is American or works there).

Just so you know, if this escalates to something you decide to make a police report about, you need to send a message back to the American number now that explicitly says you do not want to be contacted by that person again. If you don't do that then there is a possibility the police will say you haven't been clear enough, particularly because they may not be able to verify that the whatsapp and American number belong to the same person. I am speaking from experience on this having learned the hard way about how police treat such matters when I was in a very similar position to the one you are in (was being physically stalked for weeks by an ex-partner who wouldn't take no for an answer).

I'd also recommend that you think clearly about whether or not the American number could be a separate person. Was there any one else you let down gently who might have taken it as badly as this imbecile? Obv it's probably the same guy but only you can say if it is beyond reasonable doubt that they are the same person."

I think, even if I did try a dating app, I‚Äôd likely take a ‚Äúone at a time‚Äù approach so I could properly gauge the person I‚Äôm talking to, how I feel about them, and not end up in a situation where I disappoint someone, or make them feel like they‚Äôre just one of many choices. As well as give them an entirely fair shot where I‚Äôm not comparing them to someone else.

Admittedly, like I said, I‚Äôve never used a dating app. Maybe that‚Äôs partly because I really don‚Äôt feel good about talking to multiple people at once, which is apparently rather common for other people. For me, If you find someone and you feel like you click, continue. If you find someone and it‚Äôs not working, stop, try again.

Trying with like 2-3+ people at once would make me feel like I‚Äôm not giving each person my full attention, and the chance they deserve. Maybe I‚Äôm just too empathetic, but I can imagine some people might not appreciate it, either. But maybe that‚Äôs just how dating apps are meant to be?

To be completely clear though, his reaction is completely inexcusable, regardless. Threatening people for being turned down is actually nuts."

Mysoginy and abuse is the norm. He‚Äôs probably an extreme right MAGAt who idolizes those lovely ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù males Fuentes and Tate. Unfortunately it‚Äôs been my experience that that is the majority of men on those dating sites. I stopped using those a couple years ago. True story: After I became single 10 years ago I tried them off and on for about 6 years and I saw the SAME guys on those sites when I stopped using them as when I started. That‚Äôs a huge red flag to me. I‚Äôm sure there are nice guys on there but they are few and far between. I have chosen to be single, and I have found peace with that as well as safety. Be careful and make sure this douchebag is reported to the police. I believe verbal threats are still a valid reason for a restraining order and in some cases he can be arrested. If you have a local FB group called are we dating the same guy join and post his dating profile and why women need to avoid him like the plague. That page is for outing cheaters and  abusers to warn women that they are not dating material. If you live alone is there a friend or someone who can stay with you until you are sure you‚Äôre safe? 
The current administration is giving a lot of people permission to say and do anything they want and get away with it. There will be a lot more of this going forward and worse. We are on our own now. The laws will soon change and will not help us in these cases. It‚Äôs safer to stick to sex toys for now IMO. 
I hope that he‚Äôs all talk no action. Please be safe!"

He threatened he has your number and name. The police will not do anything, yet. He is throwing a fit, because for dating apps, it's difficult for men. Ratio men to woman is close 75% men, 25% woman. So when one actually, gets attention and then rejected, it's a blow to his ego. 
 Saying all this, he overreacted, and you dodge a bullet. Apparently he forms attachments, way too fast. Block him on everything, keep your communications with him. He is invoking his 1st Amendment rights, and hasn't committed a crime yet, and hopefully he won't. Just thank that you saw this side of him before anything, serious happened between the 2 of you. 
I don't know where you live, but if he continues harrassing you, and it turns to threat of violence, there is, a least in my state, a charge of harassing by communications. You have to file the charge, if it gets aggressive. However, the charge is a slap on the wrist but then it public knowledge. Might, if it gets bad, do a background check on him, or any other guy you meet online. I did, when I was dating online!! If he is acting this way after, 3 days, then he has been rejected before, maybe many times and he might have a record of this. The police will be able to see he has a pattern. Be careful when talking to guys online! Hope this helps! Take care!!"

Make the police reports, report him to the app, make his identity and threats known to people close to you. Consider whether or not he knows where you live, how much of a hassle it would be to change your number, etc. 

There‚Äôs also another step you could consider, if bringing some genuine consequences down on his head is worth engaging further to you, and the potential of escalation.

Same thing can happen with girls, I‚Äôve met girls online, gone on dates, and they turned out to be insane - like showing up at my place of work unannounced, after following me there, and asking me to introduce her to all the girls who worked there.

Probably best not to tell men there's another guy you're interested in, especially when you lost things about the other suitor. Saying stuff like ""he's closer"" etc, all he's gonna hear is ""that guy's better than me"" and feel challenged, most likely not in a good way.

I don't take most of the internet serious, but the threats are *very* real... Don't be paranoid, but be prepared. If you are against guns or don't want one, get some Pom OC spray. It's very unlikely someone will continue an attack after being blessed with the hot sauce.

The list goes on and on so I finally blocked him because he did all this in the middle of the night. 

Over the next YEAR he was still texting me off random numbers, sometimes he‚Äôd pretend to be different people, saying they wanted to buy something from me but most of his messages were him pretending to be random men who saw my ‚Äúad‚Äù (there was never any ad and it‚Äôs been proven all 44 numbers were him). I thought he was insane but tried to ignore it. 

One Sunday morning I‚Äôm eating breakfast with my kids and I get a message request on Facebook and when I checked it, it was someone letting me know photos of me were posted on a fetish website and he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd consented to the pictures being posted. 
I burst into tears, had him direct me to where I could find these photos and I was crying and shaking and decided I finally needed to call the police. 

After I called the police and they‚Äôd come to talk to me, seen evidence and called me down, I start getting call after call from a blocked number and I called the police again because he was leaving me the most unhinged voicemails and lucky for me he called when the police were there and the 2 officers heard him say if I didn‚Äôt shut the fuck up, it wouldn‚Äôt be my photos being sent out and posted next time it would be the ‚Äúcommunity of people who‚Äôd love the photos you have of your boys‚Äù (I don‚Äôt have naked photos of my sons on my but I have tons of photos regardless). This police case was messy and I decided to sue him, since he did put me in serious danger by mainly posting photos of my face with disgusting captions. Best part? I‚Äôd never sent him a single one of the pictures posted, he‚Äôd been able to hack into my iCloud and took them from there. 

I know it‚Äôs a long story but PLEASE report this man any way you can. The app and especially the police. See if you have a ‚Äúare we dating the same guy‚Äù Facebook group and post there. Start the paper trail and take precautions. Nothing is too small."

This ""Man"" felt entitled to your undivided attention just because you were messaging with him on a dating app? He must not get many matches.  I was committed/married well before dating apps. I spent 3 months on them post separation/divorce and even as a dad bod ""newly single"" and have kids I got dates and conversations. Blaming non chemistry for the few real people I got to talk to, I'm almost 100% positive that the nicest way to back out of a match is to admit to or create a lie about a new match. It's fucking speed dating without meeting. The only proper response to ""I want to pursue a different opportunity"" in any form should be ""great, hope it works out."" Dating online is IMHO the lowest energy of trying to date and you should never be upset with the result. Three fucking days of texts and this guy thinks he has rights üíÄ"

I remember online dating was frustrating like this.  It's very superficial and people can share intimate details with you and then decide they want to date someone else for XYZ.  Dating didn't used to be like that.  You'd get their number in person if you already had a connection.  The habit of texting as a primary means of communicating also seems to encourage social cowardice.  This guy is definitely off his rocker, probably from a string of bad experiences, but OP is contributing to the overall climate of impersonal channel surf dating."

This guy's a narcissist and you do not want to find out how far they're willing to go. In my experiences, these people are looking to prove themselves in possibly any way. 


Cease all contact with him. Let your friends and family members know. Make all your socials accounts private. If you have children, remove their photos from public eye. Document everything including texts and details from him. If he knows certain places you frequent such as coffee shops and gyms, change your routine for now. Look him up on the internet to see if he's on any sort of registry. Report him on the app and Call the police. The police may or may not be helpful but it is useful to have a report down in case something happens to you OR something else.

Years ago I had an upstairs neighbor threaten me with violence who was taller as well as fifty pounds heavier + martial arts and I did everything I could to stay safe. The building wouldn't let me break the contract and the management was shifting during my whole ordeal so I was possibly really at risk. Next I had a narcissistc roommate who tried to get violent with me and I did the exact same thing. I draw narcissists, trust me, you do not want to find out. They don't play by the same rules you do, in fact, they bend them to their suit. By trying to stay safe very least you're protecting their future victims. Carry mace if you have to."

A lot of people might want to chalk this up to just the guy being a dick head and think you might be overreacting, but as a woman and a survivor of sexual assault and I grew up in a community with men who hurt women and there are no consequences - I take this seriously. 

Don't get yourself too anxious to the point of where it's hard for you to do your daily things. Just take it seriously, be extra aware of your environment, your surroundings, and the people in them. If you get a weird feeling about someone, trust yourself, even if it's not this guy it's better to just always be prepared to run or call attention to yourself if someone presents a threat to you when you're in public. If you are the kind of person who likes to walk around with headphones on at night, you might want to stop doing that for a while. They have these cool headphones now that actually amplify whatever noise is surround you. So it looks like you have headphones on and you can't hear, but actually you are listening even more to your surroundings. I can't remember what it's called but it's a pretty cool feature.

Definitely file a report of the threat locally so if anything happens, the record will be there and they will take it more seriously. Ask your local authorities what you can do to protect yourself.

Again, I want to repeat, don't walk around living in fear and drowning in anxiety about it.

When you wake up and you get ready to go out the day, just take a deep breath, summon your strength, and be aware and prepared there is a possibility of danger so you're aware & prepared.

 That's all you can do. 

I wish you the best outcome of this situation."

She should report him. It's not safer to ghost people in those of you giving that advice are idiots. It's better to know where a threat is coming from so that you can report it and handle it and protect yourself then for it to suddenly show up at your doorstep. 

As for the doorstep part 
She's a liar, this woman is from England she claims and lives in England. She's saying that a person from America is threatening her. This happens to thousands of men and women all the time and as somebody who has survived trafficing and assault this is f****** terrifying when it actually happens to you. But this is ragebait and fear mongering. Use this fake accounts post as a great example of what is going on and at this actually happens to raise awareness for this kind of violence. I say this as a survivor. However but if you look through her comments you'll find out that her story not only has inconsistencies but that she's not even in the same country as the person so she claims. From the looks of it either A. She bumped into a scam artist online, or B. She's outright lying for clout because this does really happen to people. It has happened to many of us. 


If you know anything about how phones work especially when it comes to area codes, and various other things. Messaging is different whether you're using a phone's direct line or you are using an app. If she is using an alternative app and the person really is in another country. The best thing she can do is report them and handle it appropriately. Is highly unlikely that somebody is going between continents for her. Taking precautions is the smart thing to do and not letting the fear that these people thrive on as a power dynamic engulf you as a survivor. 


As somebody who escaped violence in trafficking years ago I noticed these inconsistencies. I'm going to be blocking and reporting the account for feeding on our fears."

That said...

This is part of the reason why dating apps are so god damn depressing and defeating. I'm not defending his reaction by any means, but you can avoid this kind of thing by not having multiple suitors like you're Queen Elizabeth I. I never understood the folks who chat up multiple people at once. Really is a hit to the 'ol self-esteem when you're talking to someone you like, you think there's a connection, they leave you on read for a few days and then come back with the, ""Sorry, you were basically one of five contestants and you didn't win. Better luck next time!"" You feel like you're in active competition with who knows how many others when you're talking to someone, and it's just...yeah. No thanks. The only thing more soulless and demeaning is condensing the entirety of your self worth and accomplishments into a resume, and then having it shit on during an interview.

If my wife and I, God forbid, end up divorced, I'm going to be a hermit forever as opposed to getting back into that bullshit. My self-esteem and confidence was never worse than it was back in those awful OkCupid days."

Had no idea the person I'd go on dates with was talking to a few other guys and or seeing/sleeping with them and me. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I felt that was disrespectful.  Some of them were even married i found out. So I was perpetually ina bad mood about dating or talking to people. Just had to be by chance I was on a meme page and always wound up battling one person.

"AIO I (28f), met this guy (37m) on a dating app and we spoke for about 3 days but I found a connection with someone else and he threatened me",skailantern,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifunbm,sarethatraeus,"Certainly not overreacting, based on his responses. Those are entirely inexcusable after the second paragraph. As the other responses have said, report him to the app, possibly report that phone number to the police and use the screenshots to validate the reaction, particularly the overt threat.

But in the interest of being fair, you're not entirely blameless either. His extended reaction is monstrous and out of place, obviously; however, you were speaking with him for 3 days, you made plans with him, then canceled them last-minute purely because the other man was 'more convenient' in your own words. That is deeply and inexcusably rude, thoughtless, and immature, and his feelings of being manipulated, toyed with, and spuriously abandoned are just as valid as your fear of his response to your actions. Consider how you would react if the situation was switched around; wouldn't you be angry, hurt, and upset? Especially if - as this guy has clearly experienced - it's been done to you before, repeatedly?

Yes, his continued responses are absolutely out of pocket and a massive overreaction on his part; but I can promise you that hurt and anger didn't come from nowhere, and being treated like something that can be played with and then tossed away on a whim is never going to result in someone going saying ""Okay, that's totally fine! Slay!"" regardless of their sex or gender. 

So be safe, but do better."

I don't care if this is a hot take you do no good to tell me I'm wrong. I genuinely believe this. Op whilst absolutely didn't deserve this the behavior on the guys end is gross but I also see what he's saying in that you setup a date with multiple people and cancel one and yiu even said the other guy is closer so it's out of convenience. And I'm sure you seen a picture probly think he's cuter as well. Just shallow behavior on all sides if you ask me. And you aren't gonna find real love that way. You might think you have and you may even have successful years. Maybe even 10 or more. But I promise you if your foundation is built this shallow it will crumble.

I can only imagine how much pain this person has gone through. The amount of times he just wished someone would show up to a date they set. Yes rejection is a thing but so is success. There shouldn't be that much rejection on dating apps that it drives someone insane. I cannot blame them for the actions caused by the other person. The amount of mental stress that goes through someone just trying to meet. They weren't asking for a lot; just one date over something trivial like coffee.

-You made a date with this person and cancelled because you cherry picked someone more convenient for you. 

-How this person responded to you was certainly not the right way. It was aggressive, suggested violence, psychotic behavior, and was over the top. 

This all could have been avoided if you were more understanding of how fragile people's egos can be. How would you feel if you got your hopes up, bought some nice clothes, told your friends you are going on a date, made arrangements, came up with a whole story line in your head about what to say and how it will go... Only for it to be ripped away last minute? It's an uncomfortable feeling that triggers dangerous behavior like this person portrayed.

Like we really honestly don't care to know, dating is hard, and telling any person who got their hopes up is gonna hurt and sometimes hard

Threatening you is obviously way over the top, but it's probably just best with people you haven't known that long to just move on and spare them the explanation of whatever you're doing because they're not that invested in you anyway beyond potential romance

If I told any girl I was going to date another girl I'd be surprised if they didn't tell me to fuck off too tbh

I called the cops and guess what, he was a convicted rapist who had failed to report his current location and the cops found him and arrested him. So, you never know who you might save.  Also, why the FUCK are convicted rapists ever allowed to walk free?!"

I'm male and have had to get the police involved before (over an ex-partner who just could not take no for an answer and kept turning up unannounced at my front door and bars and clubs that I frequented and that she had never been to but knew I would be there, and would not stop texting asking me to meet her). They handled it terribly and accused me of not having been clear enough because there was no text message from me that explicitly told her to stop messaging me (I was simply not replying to any of her messages at all and thought she would eventually stop, I had also told her in person that it was categorically over and to stop bothering me).

Basically, the British police seem to take a position of ""If there is no text record of you saying it then it didn't happen, and if you haven't said it by text then we will treat it as though you want the contact and that it is your fault""."

-You made a date with this person and cancelled because you cherry picked someone more convenient for you. 

-How this person responded to you was certainly not the right way. It was aggressive, suggested violence, psychotic behavior, and was over the top. 

This all could have been avoided if you were more understanding of how fragile people's egos can be. How would you feel if you got your hopes up, bought some nice clothes, told your friends you are going on a date, made arrangements, came up with a whole story line in your head about what to say and how it will go...

Even if there was nothing they could at the moment, if things escalate it will help your case if they already have documentation of previous events. For example it's gonna be much harder for him to lie about the timeline and nature his actions and your relationship if you've already given cops the recepits.

Also I don't remember what the term for this was but humans have bias towards the first version of events they hear. If you wanna be believed your best bet is to take control of the narrative by acting as soon as possible."

on top of this, many people have had issues with the apps not properly sending notifications, and many men have had women use that as an excuse for ghosting, so their response is to get away from the app asap.

its also why many people will ask for snapchat too.  anything to have that disconnect from the extremely competitive environment on the dating app so building a proper slow emotional connection is possible.

where is the balance?  take too long to get to know someone, respect their boundaries and the pacing, and get outcompeted.  be too quick, and you result in rushing things and making the woman feel uncomfortable and likely backing out as a result.  wonder if theres a way to make both groups of people happy by limiting the amount of people you can message at once, but that is likely only to make an extremely selective process way more selective."

My opinion is no, don‚Äôt respond. What he wants is probably one of two things: 1.) to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù you for rejecting him which will only result in more disrespect and threats at the minimum‚Ä¶ or 2.) to neg you into going back to him instead of the other guy, either to actually get the date or just feed his ego. Either way, it‚Äôs about him wanting to have power over you. 

Also, woman to woman‚Ä¶ I noticed when he talked to you like a crazy person you apologized and tried to explain yourself. Don‚Äôt do that sis, anyone who talks to you that way is undeserving of your sympathy.  Abusers watch the way you react to them when they‚Äôre being a dick, and apologizing when you‚Äôve done nothing wrong (rejecting someone is fine for any reason, and you even did so politely) signals to them you could be their preferred target for bullying into submission.  

You can be polite, but be stern. You don‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation or an apology. No is a complete sentence sis.

Also this guy sounds like a pathetic sack of shit looking for a younger woman to creep on. That text you received was creepy for sure, but also had a tone of a person scolding a child. Maybe be on the lookout for signs of that in the future too‚Ä¶"

She met someone she really liked and wants to pursue things with. So she let the guy she did have plans with know that those plans wouldn‚Äôt be going ahead.

Which is pretty standard behaviour to do when you met someone you want to be serious with. You let anyone else you have been talking to for a significant time frame that you are no longer looking for romance/sex/dating elsewhere. 

Her only other option was to ghost. And this was before she knew he was an abusive POS. Most people are not going to ghost someone they had plans with that week. They will let them know that those plans will not be happenings 

It is completely normal on dating apps to let those who you had plans with/been talking to for awhile that you will not be going ahead with future plans due to meeting someone who you see a potential future with

I‚Äôve had guys do it to me, and I‚Äôve done it to others when I met my now partner. 99% of the time people take it well. It‚Äôs just the nature of being on a dating app.

They hadn't even been on a single date yet. And it's absolutely normal to chat with multiple people on dating apps. Women get dozens if not hundreds of messages they need to weed thru people by chatting with them. It's not normal to just talk to one person at a time, pre date, on a app. Especially when the convos are only a few days long. Women don't owe strange men fidelity when they have never met them before, are not in a relationship with them at all, and are not committed to them in any way. This person was not her boyfriend. Just a strange man on the internet. Nothing more. You talk with them to pre date to vet them to determine if a first date is even in the cards. Sometimes that takes days or weeks. And sometimes you will go thru dozens of chats with dozens of men before you find one you feel safe, compatible, and comfortable enough to go on a first date with. That's just the way it is. She did absolutely nothing wrong. Furthermore talking to a man or going on one date with a man does not mean you owe that man loyalty either. You owe loyalty and fidelity to people who you are in a committed long term relationship with not strangers you are just meeting or haven't met yet. Talking to someone does not mean anything. That person isn't owed commitment, a date, or a relationship just because you talked to them on a app. Your acting like she's an immoral cheater or something for JUST TALKING with multiple strangers to find a person she likes and wants to commit to. Sometimes while chatting with strangers you like one over the other and go in a different direction. Men do this too on apps."

He is a dangerous person that wants to be abusive.  Normal people, who you barely know, do not behave like this.
I don't know which jurisdiction you live in but some laws are pretty much similar, so here is my advice.

Do not forget to:
-First, make sure that you give him a cease and desist order: demand that he never talks to you again, and you do not want him to contact you.  The order will be legally binding in most states if you tell him on the phone (EDIT: through text message, easier than recording a phone call).  This will allow you to SUE him for harassment if he continues, and to HAVE HIM ARRESTED for stalking, confronting you, or trespassing.

-Then alert the police to the situation, and they will then be able to take that order and should something happen, enforce laws better than if he says ""but she's my friend and I was upset""

-Then take all of that to the dating app and he will probably be labeled a predator.

-Last but not least, and this is just me, but I would get a firearm.  Carrying a firearm for defense, if you can, is a great way to have a resort in a life-or-death emergency.  You deserve peace of mind and security.  If firearms are not an option a compact pellet gun in .25 caliber is better than fists, but you have to be vigilant regarding reliability because they can leak from the air tank sometimes.
You might live in a place where firearm ownership is not allowed, or you are not allowed to use a weapon as a weapon.  This means even for self defense.
You do have a risky option: You can get a big dog, though, for a period of time, and then any assault you face could have a violent animal on your side.  But if you talk to the police they might be on the lookout for him, and going everywhere with a big dog is something you might not have to do for peace of mind.

Good luck!"

Do guys think I uninstall the app when their texts get moved? Nope. Still checking bumble. Still checking hinge. Your odds ONLY improve if you meet in person. Real people > virtual people. 

Also, please seek therapy if you think chatting all day and all night via text is building anything real. You're dining on empty calories. ""Build an emotional connection."" I literally snorted. Go on a date. 

And dudes ask for Snapchat because they are hoping to get to sexting and pics will be sent. 

And once again, they have perfected the message sending. No one is ""missing"" your message anymore than ""oops, I JUST saw your text."" The msg are being sent, the receiver is choosing to ignore, or the msg was never typed and sent. 

Want to know the balance? Know what you're looking for and ask questions about those things. Then just ask about people's weekend plans or plans for the week. The answer literally doesn't make a difference unless they are out of town. It only serves as a segue to say, ""Sounds like you might be around on [insert day of week], want to go on a date?"" And point blank ask. Not ""we *_should_* go out"" or ""it'd be great to talk in person"" or whatever stupid thing.

From my understanding different apps have different intentions/practical usage. Maybe Match would be better than Tinder for example. 

Respect for shooting your shot in the real world. That said, usually pretty obvious to both parties from like body language, flirty vibe etc if want to be more than friends, and striking while the iron is hot usually better so intentions are clear up front. 

Dating apps have edge of clarity of what person is looking for up front (as long as honest) and less fallout if things don‚Äôt work out. Friends of friends have kinda been ‚Äúpre-vetted‚Äù but can lead to some kinda awkward situations later."

Clearly she made the right choice in cancelling, given his reaction; but I was taught to honor the promises and plans I make unless there's truly no other option. And her own words to him were ""I was talking to you and another guy, and he was closer so it's more convenient.""

That's not, ""I'm so sorry, -insert unavoidable situation,- I have to cancel."" It's not even, ""I met someone else and we just clicked so immediately, I'm so sorry but I don't want to lead you on."" Her reasoning was, ""This guy's closer and more convenient."" 

On a personal level, I find that shallow, rude, and inconsiderate. And perhaps because I'm a man and have firsthand knowledge of how egregiously, predatorily exploitative dating apps are for us in the first place, I can't help feeling a twinge of sympathy for someone who was treated like that, even an absolute psycho like that. Probably because I'd bet dollars to donuts he didn't start out like that, and hates himself being it just as much as we do. And given the beginning of his rant before devolving into a walking crimson battery, probably became that way by being lead on, used, toyed with, and then discarded, until he let his bitterness and desperation consume him.

She absolutely did the right thing. Just not for acceptable reasons imo, and while I in no way condone or excuse this guy who should probably be either institutionalized or imprisoned, I can still recognize that his feelings are probably valid at their source."

But telling someone you canceled bc you found someone better or more convenient is more cruel.  Some lies are ok. Especially if they protect your safety and are intended to avoid hurting someone.  I'm sure you see now how it played a role in drama you don't need to deal with.  

On dating apps it's totally normal to talk to others. I just really don't think it was necessary to say as the reason you are canceling. Personally as a guy who doesn't have much trouble getting dates on apps like that it would still sting a little bit. The average guy has a pretty hard time with dating nowadays so I can see how that might have been very hurtful to him. 

 Research shows women typically find around 20% of the male population attractive, whereas men find the majority of women attractive.  So on attraction based apps it can be really hard for some men.  That's not your fault at all but try to understand why someone might be sensitive to being told that.  It's a lack of tact. Many women don't have those issues in finding dates. Even then when ive canceled for the same reasons you did, I would never say it's because I found a woman I like more. Ofc the point of apps like that is to filter until you find a good option and you owe him nothing. But being more considerate will go a long way. Either way he's absolutely crazy for responding like that."

And this doesn't mean don't go to the police at all. If he escalates the situation out of text or starts acting stalkerish, then going to the police is still a good move"

Multiply that by over 50 ""ghost"" rejections, not a single online date over a year, and only 10 matches and dudes like this CREEP start popping up.

Sure, maybe it‚Äôs kind, but honestly my approach is if I am not meeting up, or breaking up early on and its going to be over text or the app, just say that I am not interested, wish them well and immediately block them.

but this is also what seems to have led most men to rush conversations on these apps, get a woman's number ASAP, get them off the app ASAP, and get on a date ASAP.  because every second you waste makes you vulnerable to being outcompeted.

taking the example here, its clear the other guy was able to communicate and formulate the connection quicker than he was.  the guy shown here made himself out to be an anger fueled asshole, but if it wasnt for that, what evidence is there that he was just someone who would have been a better option that needed more time to formulate that kind of romantic/emotional connection?

Because then the two people are actually dating not just texting as total strangers who have never met on an app. Once you actually start dating someone yes, one prospect at a time, that's the moral thing to do.

I'm not sure how it's immoral to simply talk to a second person when you haven't even met the first, had a single date with them, and have only talked to them a handful of times over text. 

Do we owe automatic commitment to the first person to ""what's up"" us in a dating app before we've even met them in person? That seems absolutely crazy to me. 

Dating for women is different than for men. We are flooded with messages and 99 percent of them are probably in decent in nature and/or bad prospects. Yes, for women they have to talk to multiple people, talk for a long time before meeting, and try to weed out perverts/fuck boys/sexual assaulters/criminal records/crazy people like this exc through conversation before meeting..... literally for safety reasons. Because dating can be dangerous for women unlike men. We can't just run off with the first man to send us a text. 

I don't even online date. I tried and found it totally overwhelming and the prospect of meeting strangers online to be completely anxiety inducing and deleted the app."

If he's done this towards you it's likely he's done it towards other people too or may be at the beginning of a pattern of behavior where he may do it to others.  While you may not feel like you need it right now this is how interactions start with people who eventually seek orders of no contact.  It's easier if you're ahead of it.

Edit:  If you want to proceed with a report you should print out copies of your recent exchanges and go to your local police department and ask to speak to a detective.  For your comfort consider asking a friend to go with you."

Again, you're showing that you literally have never dealt with this police. Let's say this guy has a buddy in the force, or an uncle, or his dad. The cops will literally start pulling you over all the time, showing up at your house, and threatening you on a regular basis.

Ask me how I know.

The risk of retaliation is HIGH and women regularly experience this shit. 

She doesn't know anywhere near enough about this dude to know approaching the police about him is safe. The cops are NOT going to help her and there is a high probability that they will actively cause harm.

Police do nothing. They won't talk to this guy, they won't arrest him, they won't enforce a restraining order. They DO NOT HELP YOU in domestic violence situations.

Ask literally anybody who has been through this shit.

You are naive. It's sweet, but it's ultimately dumb and you're putting people at risk with your ignorant advice."

its why i ask what resources are there for individuals who require time to create chemistry, proper timing and context, etc, many of which who seem to be looking for exclusively monogomaus romantic relationships, when it seemed like dating in general was how this was accomplished before the digital age.  building up said connections through friendships often makes friends upset nowadays that one person wants to introduce romantic intentions into the mix, and it seems that dating apps arent an option for the reasons ive explained above and elsewhere, so its why i ask, what resources are there for this?"

A coworker of mine got murdered by another coworker after a few months of trying to get the police to take it seriously. 

- He asked her out, she rejected (respectfully).
- He stalked & threatened her.
- She got a restraining order against him.
- He got fired and kept sending her threats in different ways.
- He violated the restraining order numerous times but was let off with small consequences.
- He stashed a bag of guns in the woods and was sighted - it was a few metres away from the stables she would go to.
- Police confiscated the guns and traced them back to him.
- Two days later she was found dead at the stables and shot in the head. 

There were so many times they could have done something to stop her death but they didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôll be released in 20 years at 47 years old. She died at 21. It angers me so fucking much. Literally every damn person knew this guy was fucked up but he was protected every step of the way. They treat women like hypochondriacs until they become a full-fledged victim to the unsurpassable degree. Rapes not even enough to get them to do their chasing, it has to be death or near-death.

Cushioning men‚Äôs feelings doesn‚Äôt matter when your life could be on the line. Don‚Äôt ever be bullied out of taking precautions for your own safety. To know that my coworkers mother spent 8 months terrified of her kids safety just for her to be killed so despicably is just gut-wrenching. Not to mention that the day after it happened, she was bombarded with fucking journalists. It‚Äôs disgusting and you don‚Äôt realise the magnitude of how little safety and justice there is until you see it happen to someone you knew."

Total nonsense, how can you make a statement like that about non existent individuals. You are both adults engaging with adult life. By the time you get to this age, age is irrelevant, it is about each individual and each individual alone. The 28 year old could quite easily be vastly ahead of the 37 year old in life, number obsession. You have absolutely no idea what place they are at in life. 


>I feel like it would be kinda hard to relate to each other at that point

Also nonsense. You can't relate to people 9 years older? Lmao.

If he hadn't brought up age at all maybe you could just chalk it up to him being a garden variety creep, and it having nothing to do with the age gap. But he calls her a ""kid"" when he gets heated.

I think the way they are structured can unintentionally shape how we view others. People swipe on profiles based on pictures and short bios reducing people into traits and data points rather than seeing the as whole multifaceted people. The competitive nature of the apps can make connections feel transactional and detached instead of encouraging connections. 

It gives the idea that people are products to be selected from and can contribute to the feeling of competition. The apps are selling the idea of ‚Äúoptions‚Äù in a way but that can also be what is reinforcing the unrealistic or superficial standards for what a match should look like leading to harmful patterns (insecurity, frustration). 

While they were made to bring people together, it might be more of a contribution to the issue."

Upon my plate, a tree of emerald hue,
So bold it stands, yet oft misunderstood.
A veggie strong, with florets fresh in view,
A feast of green that does the body good.

No simple sprout, nor leaf so frail and meek,
But firm and proud, with stems that reach the sky.
Its taste, a test for those whose tongues are weak,
Yet strength it grants to those who give it try.

In butter bathed or roasted crisp and bright,
With garlic kissed or crowned with melted gold,
A humble stalk brings pure and true delight,
Its virtues vast, its story proudly told.

So hail to thee, O broccoli divine,
Forever shall thy leafy glory shine!"

all this is to say, if you ever were to have a son, don't resent him for things he has not done, don't presume his intentions, don't teach him or imply that he is naturally a violent rapist. for these are the prerequisites to spawn the corrupt mind that you despise so. just tell him right from wrong. that's all it should take for a normal boy. this world and MOST of the people living in it are too beautiful, complex, and diverse to hold prejudice and hate toward any one group. to reduce an entire group to the actions of an outlier."

Which wasn‚Äôt the case at all. 

OP wasn‚Äôt being shitty by talking to a guy to discover if she had interest, and rejecting him 3 days later when she realized she didn‚Äôt want to continue.

UserCup wasn‚Äôt been shitty by recognizing some men feel possessive at ‚Äúfirst glance‚Äù.

Firstly not a citizen.
Secondly up until I had my stroke(and list my dad in the same month) I worked from 13 helping ppl.
I am in the UK and my big bug bear is elderly and disabled children care. So around working raising a kid and getting a lot of education, I set up a dozen weekly lunch programs so oaps get a nutritious meal and social interaction for six hours a week. 
Helped run a play scheme for severely disabled kids, after school literacy programmes always been a part of setting up and staffing the UK's biggest disability awareness event, taught computer literacy to retirees, helped ppl with mental health problems get into education, worked safe guarding children in danger and taken in 3 kids who's parents failed them all of that unpaid. Joined every lobbying campaign against wars, to help refugees, prison reform, LGBTQ rights.
I was stuffing envelopes for council elections when I was in nappies,  my dad would feed the homeless on our town even when we were struggling to feed ourselves. I carry shock blankets on my bag to give to the unhoused because they keep them warm and dry. 
And my day job is counselling traumatized ppl. But no I don't care about ppls suffering. And you know where my dad learnt that to teach us? His rich aristocratic grandparents because how much money and privilege someone has said nothing about there character so BT may not have deserved out sympathy but his sons do so do the ppl who thought they were going to be the next shot. 
Dont tell me who I am I am fucking proud of how I have lived my life because my dad taught me right. 
He was a soldier and he had to kill HE HAD TO to save the ppl stood right beside him forty years it started with him even as he was dying, he was a good man Luigi is a murderer , do you see the difference?

I never did the online dating/dating apps route because I knew ‚Äùplaying the field‚Äù wasn‚Äôt for me (I‚Äôm not that sociable lol) and that‚Äôs what those dating services primarily facilitate. That being said, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúplaying the field‚Äù is a moral failing and it does make sense to me - you‚Äôre probably more likely to find someone you really like and less likely to settle with a bad choice if you‚Äôve had exposure to more potential partners.

I think if people are on the dating apps they should be aware that unless they‚Äôve explicitly communicated exclusivity with each other, they‚Äôre likely going on dates with other people as well. And it can take a few dates before people can discern if there‚Äôs a connection or not worth pursuing.

However, all that didn‚Äôt really align with my personality and it seems like you‚Äôre in the same boat as well! Luckily, it ended up working out for me and I hope it does for you too. I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äùromantic‚Äù and was really holding out for something that felt organic. (No shade to people that found their match on a dating service, I have friends that are in great long-term relationships with their match!)

Yes, the survey was done in 10‚Äìyear intervals so by 1978 the mean number of partners college women had ever dated dropped to 14! By the 1950s, there was actually a \*decline\* in the trend of multiple dating so the 1958 amount was probably \*even lower\* than what it would have been in the 1920s-1930s which is kind of crazy to think about."

I am not blaming her for his action, simply pointing out that she could have handled it better, thus possibly avoiding all his craziness. 

Done arguing with and idiot who can only think in terms of Black and white, has poor comprehension skills, and can barely articulate thought and reasoning. 

However, i will leave you with an example: I go up to a grizzly bear, look it right in the eyes and growl at it. It mauls me and kills me.  Maybe it would have mauled me either way- i can't be blamed for it's nature. Does that absolve me of the things I did that may have contributed to the outcome. Does it magically make it an untrue statement to say ""he shouldn't have got so close, looked it in the eyes or growled at the bear""?"

"AIO I (28f), met this guy (37m) on a dating app and we spoke for about 3 days but I found a connection with someone else and he threatened me",skailantern,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifunbm,More_food_please_77,"I don't personally think it's a moral failing to play the field.

Experience will improve your odds, but if all your experience comes from casual relationships that never pushed your ability to adapt and compromise, it wouldn't give you the knowledge and experience you benefit from in a serious relationship. As long as you give everything you see potential in your all you'll benefit, but of course once you no longer see potential it's time to move on.

Sure, to a certain degree I see how if on a dating app you should be ready for people to not take exclusivity seriously, but that's mostly because faith in people is quite low to begin with.

Imagine having gone on several dates with someone, things seem to be going great, then suddenly nothing, ghosting is not fun for anyone, but even if it wasn't ghosting, and just a text saying they had decided to go with option number 3, which you weren't even aware of was a thing, it would probably not only be disappointing but hurt too, feeling very expendable, even used. If you announce it before hand sure, then there's no issue, like ""I'm currently seeing a few people to find the right for me"" there' NO issues there.

Then there are degrees of integrity, like how far are they going with each date. ""Yeah I'm sleeping with a different person each day of the week until I feel like I know who to cut off"", people might have more issues with that.

Thank you, I've actually missed out on several chances because I wasn't sure enough it would work in the long run or that I couldn't provide what they really needed, and so I chose to let them down gently before I felt it had gone too far. Wanting things to be organic is a difficult preference these days, I too am a romantic, so sexually aggressive people make me question their priorities. I'm glad it worked out for you."

Murder is a crime in every single country in the world that has a functioning society and the point still stands that Luigi Mangione killed a man.

I think it‚Äôs dangerous to hold him up as a revolutionary and heroic figure, because it legitimises what he did (killing another human being).

As it stands, LM will go to prison for what he did and rightly so. My heart goes out to him for the health problems he faced and the obstacles that were put in his way to resolve them by healthcare companies. However, he chose to deal with his problems by committing murder, which overshadows the whole point he was trying to make (ie that healthcare companies are evil) because, to make that point, he committed evil by killing Brian Thompson."

His act just felt too 'indie' and not really professional for prime time. When he main-evented against Moxley at Fyter Fest, he looked like a guy pretending to be a wrestler the way he moved and looked. And Moxley drawfed him when he came out. He looked like he should be eating Janella.

I was a 12-ish year old kid watching Raw when the Katie Vick angle happened. I thought it was weird but it basically had no effect on me other than that, positive or negative, and that's way more fucking dumb and offensive than probably anything AEW has ever done on TV. But I was used to wrestling in that era being weird and crazy and ridiculous and ""offensive"" and vulgar and gross, because I started watching in 1999, and yeah I rented tapes from WWF/WCW PPV's from the 90's, but the first WWF stuff I saw on tape was 1999 shit, which was like the most vulgar/offensive/dumb/brutal year in many respects, although 2003 was bad as well. Watching Mick Foley get his head hit with repeated unprotected chair shots while being handcuffed was one of the first PPV's I watched, rented from the downtown video store.

I'm always going to be cautious about betting against him because of the legions of weird fanboys he has and the willingness of investors to go along with him, but as it stands, I can right now use WeChat for: doctor appointments, ordering take out, public transport, booking a taxi, buying flight tickets, booking hotels, playing games, creating custom stickers, membership offers from pretty much every conceivable business, online shopping, interacting with local government services.

It would still allow anyone that really wants to get a program to have it, and the program itself could still self update without having to plug back in, but it would add that one extra step that would keep your average person from accidentally downloading something they shouldn‚Äôt.

Apple's head of security speaks out against iPhone app sideloading in new interview,Psy-Demon,https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/18/apple-head-of-security-iphone-app-sideloading/,Raidriar13,"If apps are offered on both App Store and 3rd party app store, I see no problem. 

It‚Äôs only when developers start pulling their apps out of the App Store and exclusively into their own app stores that it begins to crack. Hear me out. 

Sideloading is a niche setting for the technologically literate. The average consumer downloads apps from either the App Store or the Play Store, because this is the most convenient and easiest to understand.

We don‚Äôt have a Meta Store because there‚Äôs no incentive for Zuck to build one. Why? Because only Android allows sideloading, they have to go through the App Store on iOS. It will be a terrible user experience on Android if they pull their apps from the Play Store and onto the Meta Store exclusively, and probably push some people to buy iPhones instead.

But if we start allowing 3rd party app stores on iPhone, there‚Äôs now a huge incentive. They can make a Meta Store and put FB, Insta, WhatsApp, Oculus app, etc. on it, and pull it out of both App Store and Play Store. 

Now, Meta can say, whichever phone you buy, you‚Äôll still need to download the Meta Store. They can justify that it‚Äôs the same user experience on both operating systems now.

If one of the big name companies with apps does this, it effectively means sideloading becomes turned on by default on any phone, and it‚Äôs a slippery slope from there."

""BuT hoW aBouT tHoSe tEcH iLLiTeRaTe pEoPLe"" you, as someone who understands tech, should teach them, to not install anything outside App Store. It ain't that hard. It's not my fault if you're too lazy to do that.

And finally, this side loading can gives me much more positive impact. First, no more Safari-based 3rd part browser. I can finally install a real Chrome that based on Blink, or a real Firefox that based on Gecko. Second, I can install some older games/apps that's no longer available on App Store (literally also some advantage of having a Windows device/Android, you can run old apps on it). And last, emulators, baby! Can wait to use my iPad Mini as some Switch or PS3 emulator. Don't forget about FOSS too, but I won't mention it here.

Seriously think there will be bad sites that popup asking you to download their app. It happens on Android and it's a big reason why adblockers are so important. Sideloading on iOS introduces a new threat vector.

Sideloading on iOS & Android only benefits powerusers and the average user really doesn't need it, certainly not grandma.

Edit: Inserted -on iOS & Android- to clarify my point. Sideloading on Android is the same effect and most users rarely ever use the feature. The freedom is great and I've done it to load an older version of AccuWeather for example. Users don't understand those risks especially if an app has security vulnerabilities that are patched out in newer versions."

I'd LOVE a Microsoft, Steam, Epic Games Store app on my phone, if I can buy a game once and play it on Windows, Macbook, Phone, etc.. that's fantastic.

And if I can still play my 'investment' on another device, that's what works.

But yeah, terrified for the random website, that will forward a certificate and install it into a parents or a kids phone that's trying to install some gta/fornite hack, they think they are following the right instructions, next thing you know App store is replaced with another app that is called an App Store.

Yes, it's safer within the app store.

Hopefully iOS will make a distinction between side loaded and AppStore loaded apps and adjust permissions accordingly (via a VM, container, or some other mechanism).

Obviously not perfect, but security is a never ending game of cat and mouse.

Edit: I wonder if the EU rules would allow the user to enable different levels of side loading; examples: App Store only, trusted third party App Stores, full side load. With appropriate warnings anytime the setting is changed.

Obviously it‚Äôs still a vector that scammers could exploit - likely wouldn‚Äôt even slow them down much - but should block casual exploitation like zero click installs and malicious ads prompting a user to install apps."

To all the folks saying ""tHen jUsT dOn'T SiDELoAd"" the whole point is that it's not just allowing the users who want to sideload today, it's opening the door for side loading to become THE way that major companies push folks to access their apps. 

Regardless of what OS team you're on, the ""freedom"" of the android and side loading is that it also requires a much higher degree of knowledge, decision making, and active self protection by the users - that inherently means more security/malware/support issues. 

If you want or need all that, you're probably gonna fucking hate a lot of things about iOS across the entire experience anyway, so you go Android. If you have zero understanding or desire to add that level of responsibility to your digital life, then maybe you aren't married to Android and the iPhone simplifies this for you.

Entire domains of cybersecurity threats, including some of the most pernicious like ransomware, are practically non-existent on iOS and iPadOS as a direct result of their centralized and regulated distribution model for third party software. And I hope you don‚Äôt need convincing that other desktop platforms are moreso ripe for cybercriminality.

While Apple certainly has a financial self-interest in monopolizing distribution on these platforms (and should be considered critically for that reason), desktop operating systems absolutely corroborate the argument that sideloading is inherently insecure and foists tremendous security risk on the user, including within Apple‚Äôs own ecosystem. Many people - myself included - specifically place value in the locked-down model of iOS because it enforces a plainly better security model and more discipline upon third party developers.

I think what most people don‚Äôt realize is that it‚Äôs very likely that the first adopters would be companies who can actually afford to do their own hosting, marketing, and distribution. No indie developer will decide to make their first app as an app store for the app they‚Äôre really trying to build. 

Take Adobe, for example. They have 28 apps on the App Store right now. Assume I‚Äôm a person whose workflow relies critically on Adobe Acrobat Sign, and at the same time I‚Äôm the person who keeps getting told ‚Äúthen don‚Äôt sideload if you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù

Adobe then decides to put all their apps on the Adobe App Store exclusively. Well, might as well throw that ‚ÄúAllow sideloading‚Äù toggle out the window because I don‚Äôt have a choice but to turn it on so I can continue to use Adobe Acrobat Sign, or leave it off and settle with a crappy experience in a browser or wherever. 

But still, the keyword here is ‚Äúexclusively‚Äù. If they make 3rd party app store apps equally available on the App Store, then we‚Äôre going to be okay, and I can leave my ‚ÄúAllow sideloading‚Äù toggle off.

better for who? Appstore is great for end users. Apple enforces a lot of restrictions that are user-friendly, and anti-developer. Developers complain about having to jump through hoops and paying a huge commission fee, yet they still do it, because the access to these users outweigh the cost of these barriers to entry.

I would assume apple would put the same security and a warning to inform the user the app their installing an app outside the app store. 

Whats the difference between apps outside the app store and a scammer just sending you a url thats just there to steal your info or trick you into login to fake websites? All these apps outside of will be sandboxed, so it wont be stealing info the second you install it."
Apple's head of security speaks out against iPhone app sideloading in new interview,Psy-Demon,https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/18/apple-head-of-security-iphone-app-sideloading/,AwfulProgrammer1,"What makes you think just clicking on something will simply install the app? I would assume you'll need to opt in to allow third party apps and then be warned you are installing outside of the app and a bunch of other steps before finally getting to install it. Also even if you do install an app outside of the app store, the app is still sandboxed, it wont be able to do anything that other ios apps cant do. On android there are a ton of shady apps from questionable apk sites and none can seriously damage your phone unless its an root app. 

Scammers can still get personal info without needing to develop an ios app. With this logic apple should not allow mac users to install apps outside of the app store since its unsafe. 

No doubt there are bad actors who will try to abuse this, but with apples security they can stop this and put measures to stop it."

IMO, Sideloading doesn‚Äôt have any significant benefit and would only further cause issues in a functional ecosystem. Now tech support has to ask if you got the app from the store or a website. If it doesn‚Äôt work then it‚Äôs not their problem it‚Äôs in the developers who bypassed the legit way"

I respect the opinion (which is why I‚Äôm not downvoting anyone) of the people who think sideloading would make the platform less safe, and to some degree I agree. But I think the safety of a computer in the end depends on the end user and having it as an option wouldn‚Äôt be that bad.

I think it‚Äôs necessary for FOSS apps to begin being developed for iOS, like the apps on F-Droid. I think it matters so we can have alternatives to what Apple provides (like Cider for Apple Music on windows, which is still a tad better than the beta official app), I think it matters if you‚Äôre a developer and want to develop for iOS but can‚Äôt afford to pay the license (again, I think it‚Äôs very important for FOSS developers). 

But again, I respect your opinion and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs incorrect, I just don‚Äôt think users should have less features just because those features might hurt older or tech illiterate people who use the device.

Your ability to empathize with those around you will change the course of things around you.

I know and have met plenty of people across all generations who are tech or scam-illiterate, but are otherwise smart - gen-z included. Not everyone knows a particular company or app's UX design choices or ""best practices"", which basically change every 5 years, btw, so if you know how to post on instagram now, stop using it for a couple of years and then return to see if you are still as adept to it as you used to be.

Not everyone knows every trick in the book for scams either, myself included, as I've had to google a scam that a relative may have potentially fallen for recently, in order to figure out what the scam's angle was, and whether or not they got exposed.

Yes, old people will also side-load apps. How? Because everyone knows how to follow written instructions and directions. The problem is most people, regardless of age, don't have the ability to tell whether the source that's giving the instructions are trust-worthy or not."

_Accidentally_ sideload? Why are you pretending like sideloading is going to be this inherent thing where you can just install anything from anywhere at anytime without any warnings? Even Windows, which generally doesn't give a shit what you install on it, gets weirded out when you try installing things that it either doesn't recognize or were marked as suspicious in the past.  

With that in mind, how could sideloading ever be an accident when you need to have the specific deliberation of ignoring all the warnings on your way to installing the app (ala Android)? Even tech-illiterate people would think 3 times before doing this.

Maybe we're aging out here but have you ever become the defacto IT person for your family? For folks  older than 65? or just generally dgaf about tech and are pretty tech illiterate regardless of age?

The ""multiple warnings"" that you or I certainly would never blow passed, lots of people would just like a terms and service agreement - the classic ""I don't know, just let me download the app"" click click.  Hell, even with the warning that comes up on iPhones about stopping cross activity app tracking, there are loads of regular folks clicking allow because they assume it means the app needs that to work. 

For them to side load on accidental while it's still a niche audience doing so, would be pretty damn difficult. But, as the examples given by another commenter here, as soon as one big company utilizes this it does two things 1)It signals that the app store doesn't house ""all the apps to download"" and so when you break that seal it sends the message that you can just download from anywhere with a few extra clicks - that means folks will be more prone to downloading less than kosher apps in the same way (a new Farmville Knockoff!? Download please!) and that 2) makes any side loading warnings moot because then it'll be ""click click click to move on"" and not really the ""man this reads like a real warning, maybe I should think about it"" that we'd all love to pretend isn't the way it works. Think about the ""accept all cookies"" stuff on websites now that they have to legally warn you. I work with large scale systems and IT and I even sometimes just go ""I dont care just let me into the webpage I don't need 5 modal windows asking for my attention fine yess all cookies gtfoh"" because selecting less than that, requires me to select preferences in yet another window. 

TL;DR
Point being - people don't read. Especially if that warning becomes ubiquitous. When was the last time you read a terms and service agreement or could even quote the ""ask app not to track"" verbiage? I read warnings, but for most users never ending warnings with ""ok"" buttons are just a hindrance to get where they're going so they mindlessly or confusedly push through."

Nothing could be more human than language arts and human communication, and both teaching and learning language is hard and expensive to implement. So companies have jumped on the AI bandwagon to provide cheap content as quickly as possible. 

If you want to listen to a target language where someone reads a book, get an audiobook read by a real human. Watch Youtube videos and language lessons on youtube and podcasts, made by real humans.

gpt-4o is multimodal. it reacts to voice/sound input alongside text, without having to first transcribe to text

whisper is what provides voice to text including metadata. whisper can be run locally for free, but chatgpt doesn't use all that it provides and has moved in the direction of multimodality rather than transcription

also these developers are not using chatgpt, they're using gpt apis and/or whisper directly, which does offer capabilities absent from or abstracted within chatgpt

That being said. I've found Grok to be pretty good followed by ChatGPT. Meta will hallucinate constantly. Perchance just pretended to speak Japanese, which was funny but not helpful. Google's AI was also useless at Japanese and I would put it on par with Meta in terms of being trustworthy.

Speaking other languages is actually a foundational discovery of LLMs as the first one that really worked managed to learn French as a result of having enough references in the training material.

AI is best for asking questions about Japanese although Grok has been pretty good at teaching things like nominalizers. It does have a tendency to use exceptions to a rule when giving examples about the rule.

I use it most for practicing writing. I'm still making pretty basic sentences but I can write a paragraph to Grok, for example, and not only will it respond in Japanese, I can have it analyze the paragraph for grammar and word order.

Grok seems to also have the ability to actually scrape the web for information and so there's a chance it's more trustworthy than ChatGPT.

For reference, I don't use anki or Duolingo. I mostly read baby books, watch vlogs, practice shodo, and speak Japanese to my dog and some robots. My wife thinks it sounds sexy so I speak it to her when I can.

I experimented quite a bit with ChatGPT and abandoned it because the experience is obviously fake.

Come on, this is a bit of an exaggeration. ChatGPT occasionally hallucinates, but I've found its English to Japanese (and vice versa) translations to be quite good. My wife is a native Japanese speaker (completely fluent in English) and it almost always does better than her.

Its grammar breakdowns can be questionable, and yes I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. But usually if I get a _good_ translation of a complicated sentence, I can piece together and figure out the new grammar myself, which is very valuable.

I have been using 4o version (so I can't speak about the free 3.5 version), I am just a beginner, at N5 level, and it can generate very accurate conversations. it depends on how you prompt, but I have asked japanese friends, and what it generates it's pretty convincing according to them (way more natural and day-to-day if you prompt to use casual japanese instead of formal JLPT level - which seems to be the default). 

I have done the same for generating Chilean-Spanish - which is pretty hard to get it right, (to have another reference) and it pretty much nails it, just modify your prompts accordingly. I just generated this one, judge yourself:

[https://chatgpt.com/share/678758e6-483c-8009-ab94-a1ac567fb4a2](https://chatgpt.com/share/678758e6-483c-8009-ab94-a1ac567fb4a2)

From this, you can ask clarifications questions, you can ask for mnemonics, you can ask for rephrases, formality changes, whatever you want. pretty fucking powerful imo. I think the times chatgpt gets stuff right completetly exceeds over the times it gets it wrong (yes, we all know it's not perfect).

Its voice version sucks, I give you that. I used it for a bit but even as a complete beginner, I wasn't surprised at all. It's pronunciation it's all off (you can tell it has some american accent). I have been working on an alternative that uses chatgpt for text generation / responses, but uses Google's WaveNet Text-to-Speech (which is also AI) and the results have been pretty convincing (again, from japanese friends).

For context, I started with Genki 1, but I dropped it midway. The explanations are just way better and easier to understand if you ask chatgpt, and you can literally advance at whatever pace you want. You can ask for more examples on specific grammar, you can modify the formality, you can even prompt to use a different dialect.

I strongly recommend any Japanese learner to get [Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/) for desktop. It's mostly just for JP‚ÜíEN (and JP‚ÜíJP once you get there),  but it'll save you so much time since you'll never have to copy-paste words into a dictionary again.

 For mobile, any dictionary app will do, they all use the same actual dictionary data anyway, just with different a packaging. [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) is a popular website you can create a shortcut to, and [WordReference](https://www.wordreference.com/enja/) is the only EN-JP/JP-EN dictionary I know of along with Wiktionary that doesn't use the same aforementioned data as all the other ones. It includes exemple sentences and splits possible translations of your inputed word according according to the different meanings it could take, and provide multiple possible appropriate translations for each. Probably your best option for the EN to JP direction.

For machine translation, I don't see anyway to argue that ChatGPT isn't simply miles ahead of Google translate and even DeepL. I usually use DeepL for quick translations as it has an extension and can be quicly accessed, but I'll opt for ChatGPT if I want a more precise and natural translation.

There was a really good example here a while back, when someone asked what the difference was between Âª∫„Å¶„Çã and ÁØâ„Åè. A poster replied with ChatGPT's answer, which is that Âª∫„Å¶„Çã is used for ""building"" in the physical sense, and ÁØâ„Åè is used for ""building"" in the metaphorical sense, e.g., ""building trust.""

And the problem wasn't that ChatGPT was *wrong*. It was in fact absolutely correct that ÁØâ„Åè is used in metaphorical senses of ""building."" The problem is that its answer was incomplete, and thus, misleading. ÁØâ„Åè is used in metaphorical senses of ""building"" because it is used in the physical sense of ""building"" things in a general sense, while Âª∫„Å¶„Çã is used in the specific physical sense of ""building up"" or ""erecting."""

I suspect a developer bias, as English is currently the world's lingua franca and de facto an industry language for IT. For any other pair of languages that did not involve English, translation engines first did Language 1 -> English conversion, and then English -> Language 2. Concidering that Japanese is one of the more popular languages to learn, there would be demand for decent En > Ja and Ja > En tools, which meant it got development time. The end result is that it's good for you, an English native speaker, but prone to be misleading for a native speaker of any other language.

Secondly, I absolutely agree with the first commenter's description of ChatGPT. I have an even better: an ultimate people pleaser. LLMs are designed to tell you what you *want to hear*. Once again: what you **want** to hear. They are designed to produce an output that receives positive feedback from you.

For instance, ChatGPT is unlikely to make a typo, but it will generate unnatural patterns/grammar/sentence structures, or it will use vocabulary in unnatural ways. An imperfect text written by a native speaker is undoubtedly better. 

And this isn't to mention the fact that if you ask it to do any level of analysis, it can and will lie to you at any point.

I agree with you in the sense that one mistake in a 500-word story doesn't render the rest of the text useless, but that is not the point I'm making. I'm saying that the risks are not worth the potential rewards. 

Why risk learning incorrect word usage and unnatural patterns? As I've said countless times in this thread already, there are \*so\* many resources available for Japanese.

1. Explain grammar point/word I can't recognize and am unable to find reasonable fit in dictionary lookup. Usually this is done with sentence I encountered and struggled to read. Depending on how new/interesting answer is I'll look up supplements later.
2. Compare two similar grammar points I studied elsewhere. Or just generate more examples of 1 grammar point. I do use non-AI resources for grammar, but it can produce a lot more examples/exercises to practice with.
3. Compare two similar words and describe differences in typical usage. Especially for things like same written word has multiple readings with close meaning, which pronunciation would people use in what situation. As an example ‰∏ÄÊò®Êó• can be read as „Åä„Å®„Å®„ÅÑ and „Åä„Å®„Å§„ÅÑ. I asked it when would people read it as first vs the second.

One way I don't use it, but could see working well is just conversational practice and ask it for follow up critique. The biggest value here is just forcing myself to do more output as most of my studying is very input/reading focused.

I do agree that you probably should not use it as your sole source of grammar/Japanese study. It makes convenient partner though and you can ask it questions at any time of day with immediate responses vs a friend where I'll only ask a couple interesting ones and expect to wait couple hours to discuss."

I knew it didn‚Äôt make sense because it seemed like a pronoun based on the rest of the sentence. So I clicked the button to see what chat gpt says with that definition.This is why i say it‚Äôs not perfect, if you understand the context of the prompt you‚Äôll know why it did that. Migaku gives you multiple dictionary entries, you click on buttons based on the dictionary entry. So the AI explains it based on the initial definition. Migaku gives multiple definitions, so if I just scrolled down a little more I‚Äôd see that one of the dictionary entries is actually the correct one!

So it‚Äôs all based on the context. You have to decided whether or not the explanation makes sense based on what you know. I‚Äôd argue that the explanation is pretty good considering it gave the initial crushed to death definition in the initial prompt. I know enough to know that it‚Äôs using a different word/definition. A beginner? Not so much.

For what‚Äôs its worth, Migaku makes a half a second click worth it almost every time and you download whatever dictionary you want to use, so the quality of them is dependent on the ones you download."

The Japanese learning community is *so so so so so so* much more advanced than almost any other language learning community that I've seen out there. We have had pop-up dictionaries **for decades** and these days we have super integrated tools, automatic OCR scanning, yomitan, anki with ankiconnect, mining cards and automatically generating decks from subtitles (we've had subs2srs for the better part of a decade). Giant corpuses with frequency lists, machine-learning powered corpus database of media sorted by difficulty rankings (jpdb) and much much much more. 

It's probably one of the most technologically-friendly and forward-looking communities. 

If people tell you LLM AI is garbage, it's definitely **not** because we are blindsided by ""traditional methods"". Is it really garbage? Well, at least a year ago it was, but ChatGPT has advanced a lot and I do believe that a lot of comments against AI are still stuck on older version of ChatGPT. **However** it is still nowhere near enough to be reliable and from the way I've seen beginners abuse it (yes, including the ""generate me an N4 level short story"", which by the way don't exist cause ""N4 level"" doesn't mean anything) it is just too dangerous to recommend."
