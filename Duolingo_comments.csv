They’ve changed it so many times. 

I also liked being able to kind of jump around to more relevant sections (within a block). It feels a bit strange to have completed 75% of a course and yet not know how to say stuff like “I’m happy”.

what duolingo used to look like,calebcole7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1aqyv5h,Anono13579,I think we’re confusing each other.

I’m learning Russian so it can get really confusing at times and Duo definitely doesn’t have sentence structure correct when trying to figure it out. It’s just guessing at times but when I used to be able to go in the comment section there would be someone right at the top comment explaining the answer instead of it being a guessing game. Now if I want to know why a weird sentence is formed the way it is I have to go to Facebook and make an entire post. It’s really annoying because with all the studying they’ve done on improving Duo I learned the language a lot better understanding the whys of the sentences as opposed to “This is the answer so just memorize it.” They do have small explanations to click on up top before starting the course but people who know the language went into more detail; it was kind of like having a free tutor for a sentence you didn’t understand.

今日本語は勉強しています。

I am studying Japanese right now.

At the start I felt like I was making tremendous progress, but as I kept going, I feel like I'm stuck in a rutt now. But what makes it worse is the constant changes to the app. Some are miniscule ans some seem to completely change the app.  So I'll go back to re study a few lessons back. And then there are new words I never learned. Or they switch the hiragana/katakana to kanji. Then I'll have no clue what I'm looking at. The worst is they're is no heads up to any of this.

Then they got rid of the comment section, which was fun af, but it also allowed users to get involved within the community to help cover things people were curious about or something the lessons don't ever cover.

It just erks me I paid like $40 for 1 year and then $80 for the next and the app still seems to be testing things out.

Duolingo basically made this impossible. Daily lessons became very rubber bandy. I would have to purposely fail an easy question otherwise I would get a full on type out this translation towards the end. I would then either need to cheat and look up the answer or run out hearts.

first they started by adding ""normal"" pics to the widget, and as people started responding to it they added weirder and weirder pics.

my favorite is when you used a streak freeze your widget freezes, looks like Jack from the shining. and if you practice the day after a streak freeze it changes to duo being defrosted by the streak flame, or duo snuggling in bed with the flame . I do a lot of my practice right before I go to sleep hahaha.

Funds

In October 2011, Duolingo announced that it had raised $3.3 million from a Series A round of funding, led by Union Square Ventures, with participation from author Tim Ferriss and actor Ashton Kutcher's investing firm A-Grade Investments.[29] Duolingo launched a private beta on November 27, 2011, and accumulated a waiting list of more than 300,000 people.[17][30] It launched to the general public on June 19, 2012, at which point the waiting list had grown to around 500,000.[31][32]

In September 2012, Duolingo announced that it had raised a further $15 million from a Series B funding round led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from Union Square Ventures.[33] In November 2012, Duolingo released an iPhone app,[34] followed by an Android app in May 2013, at which time Duolingo had around 3 million users.[35] By July 2013, it had grown to 5 million users and was rated the No. 1 free education app in the Google Play Store.[36]

In February 2014, Duolingo announced that it had raised $20 million from a Series C funding round led by Kleiner Caufield & Byers, with prior investors also participating.[37] At this time, it had 34 employees, and reported about 25 million registered users and 12.5 million active users;[37] it later reported a figure closer to 60 million users.[38]

In June 2015, it announced that it had raised $45 million from a Series D funding round led by Google Capital, bringing its total funding to $83.3 million. The round valued the company at around $470 million, with 100 million registered users globally.[27][38] In April 2016, it was reported that Duolingo had more than 18 million monthly users.[39][40]

In July 2017, Duolingo announced that it had raised $25 million in a Series E funding round led by Drive Capital, bringing its total funding to $108.3 million. The round valued Duolingo at $700 million, and the company reported passing 200 million registered users, with 25 million active users.[41] It was reported that Duolingo had 95 employees.[42] Funds from the Series E round would be directed toward creating initiatives such as a related educational flashcard app, TinyCards, and testbeds for initiatives related to reading and listening comprehension.[43] On August 1, 2018, Duolingo surpassed 300 million registered users.[44]

In December 2019, it was announced that Duolingo raised $30 million in a Series F funding round from Alphabet's investment company, CapitalG.[20] The round valued Duolingo at $1.5 billion. Duolingo reported 30 million active users at this time. The headcount at the company had increased to around two hundred, and new offices had been opened in Seattle, New York, and Beijing.[45] Duolingo planned to use the funds to develop new products and further expand its team in sectors like engineering, business development, design, curriculum and content creators, community outreach, and marketing.[46]"

I speak way more German now than when I started out, for sure. Duolingo is fantastic to increase beginner level vocabulary, phrases, and “get around language” (ask for food/water, bathroom, etc). But Duolingo does really teach you grammar (unless you use desktop) so, I bought a 7 dollar book on German Grammar and studied. I also became so interested that I invested in a tutor, who practiced with me and helped me learn how to speak more naturally. And then once I got a grasp, I started to watch movies, listen to music and radio shows, read the news and now I’m moving onto books soon in German. 

People get angry that they spend a year on Duolingo and didn’t learn shit, but like… did you expect to spend 3 minutes a day on a gamified app and suddenly become fluent one day? Also, you get out what you put in. Do you practice what Duolingo teaches you? Or do you breeze through the lessons as fast as possible?

I’d be willing to bet people breeze through it and put no real effort in, because Duolingo has been a great resource for me."

WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,Donkey__Balls,"Eh, it helps when you already know the language but speak like a foreigner. They force you to listen to phrases spoken at the speed of a native speaker and train your ear plus it helps with vocabulary. 

Also helps “clean up” if your language is not very clean or proper. I jumped in to Spanish at the C1 level. Immersion is great for learning to sound almost like a native speaker but the problem is that it can make you sound too casual and say a lot of things wrong because native speakers say them wrong. Then you end up in an academic or business context and sound uneducated because you are too accustomed to slang."

They have multiple dialects, Shami(levantine) or Masri(egyptian) would be the best to learn. It's not free but it's so absolutely worth it. If you go to university, you may have access to it for free, follow up with your language department.

They are submitted with the build of the app to Google Play/Apple for review.  Google Play/Apple app store do not support dynamic icon changes, they're directly tied to the app build distributed on the app store because insuring icons meet content guidelines is part of the approval process.  The only way to change them ""dynamically"" is if the user installs a theme that specifically includes an icon for that app (on Android).

Which kinda sucks, because dynamic icons would be a cool feature, but I can also see how they'd be ripe for abuse and circumventing content policies."

Also weird poop animations and sounds. 😭 definitely encourages microtransactions so you’re better off buying an actual Tamagotchi ngl. Latter is based more off the anime, and is more plot and story driven. It’s not Sims/Animal Crossing, it’s more of an RPG. Genuinely a fun game and a rarity in the mobile department. I kept waiting for it to pester me for a microtransaction and it never did. 10/10 game imo but it isn’t a pet sim.

Honestly there are a ton of Tamagotchi clones all over the App Store. Pet sims are extremely common. Pakka Pets is one of the better ones imo but I haven’t checked it out in years so idk."

WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,Best_Stress3040,"It's hard to explain briefly, you may need to Google some of this

Japanese is an agglutinative language. It simply isn't structured like anything most of us are accustomed to.

They use ""particles"" to kinda stack words/phrases with some relationship to the overall idea of the sentence.

A sentence in Duolingo (romanized) might be ""watashi wa ocha wo nomimasu.""

Watashi means ""I""
cha means ""tea""
nomu means ""drink""

So ""wa"" is a particle that says ""watashi was the subject""
""Wo"" is a particle that says ""ocha was the object""
The ""imasu"" form of that verb is a polite way of ending the sentence for present or future tense

Duolingo doesn't really seem to convey the whole concepts of stems and particles, which become REALLY important if you try to use the vocab in literally any context other than the one presented. A noob can get all sorts of misconceptions by learning from Duolingo without outside grammar lessons, and once you start using outside sources, you realize there's no reason to go back on Duolingo

Japanese just isn't a language that English speakers can learn through rote memorization imo, it is too different structurally. For something like Spanish or French, Duolingo could be much more reasonable."

WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,BikesTrainsShoes,I'm over 1800 and flipped back and forth between German and french. It's interesting that after two years of exclusively focusing on french I flipped back to German and was back up and running in a couple days. I'm certainly not conversing with anyone in either language but I can follow along and get the jist of what they're saying.

Basically, I've learned as much from this in 16 days as I learned from my French class in elementary school.

The issue is that they don't explain a lot of the reasons the language does what it does, or why the sentence structure seems so backwards compared to English.

It really makes you understand what people say about English being hard to learn, because it's different in structure from a lot of other Germanic languages."
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,abigaelstrom,"I guess I'm the outlier here--I'm a little over 1200 and I've actually been surprised by how much I'm able to communicate (Spanish). But it's definitely a case of you get out of it as much as you put in. I challenge myself to read anything I come across that's in Spanish (for instance, HR Block's envelope had some of their ad print in both English and Spanish) and to come up with a response to it using my current vocab.

For instance, I was about to write that ""sometimes communication is about using what you *do* know and adapting your sentences to fit."" Then I offhandedly wondered if I knew enough Spanish to communicate that thought--so let's try:

""A veces para hablar a alguien, tienes que usar que lo que saber y cambiar tus oraciones por eso."" 

All words I've learned through Duolingo. It translates to ""sometimes to talk to someone, you have to use what you know and change your sentences for that."" When I type it into Google Translate just to check my logic/guess, it tells me that in this sentence ""for that"" can also mean ""accordingly,"" so hey, great guess on my part!

Now, when I flip it to translate that English to Spanish, it tells me the correct phrasing would be ""a veces para hablar con alguien, tienes que usar lo que sabes y cambiar tus oraciones en consecuencia,"" but mine's definitely close enough that a speaker would be able to understand what I'm getting at.

All of this is a lot more than you're really asking about, but hey, language learning is cool. The more you try to use it, the more you learn and pick up."

I use it mainly to learn and memorise words. Duolingo teaches you sentences without giving you any rules and explanations why and what. Just go into any language subreddit and you'll see flood of duolingo screenshot and questions about basic grammar rules of the said language."
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,LeatherFruitPF,"I've been doing German at a little over 700 days. I visited Germany recently and I was able to have a simple slow conversation with my friend's non-english speaking parents and they were quite impressed. 

Of course my speaking was like A1 level and sprinkled with mistakes (surely with the mis-gendered nouns), but I still got my thoughts across and that's what matters. I'm sure we've all spoken to a foreigner who hardly speaks English but we still understand what they're trying to say...well that's who I was to my friend's parents.

Duolingo isn't gonna teach you to be fluent, but it's certainly helpful when it comes to traveling and communicating basic expressions to the locals."

WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,jemidiah,"803 days here, recently got to B1 Spanish. 


A Mexican friend was impressed with what I could understand of spoken Spanish. I can read basic things pretty well now and at least follow the drift of conversations. If I have context, if the accent isn't too thick, and if the pace isn't too rapid, I can follow spoken Spanish decently. I now cringe when I hear extremely thick American accents speaking Spanish, like in some airports when the mayor says a few words over the loudspeakers. I can have an actual but simple conversation slowly.


I'm way better at understanding what was said than producing my own speech or writing--Duolingo really doesn't emphasize that. I'm fairly comfortable now in a Spanish-speaking country--I'm not gonna debate metaphysics, but I won't be helpless.



My time investment probably averages 10 minutes a day, maybe a touch more. It is a bit annoying when traveling internationally or to a remote area. I've barely kept it alive a good number of times--you can change your phone's time zone to give yourself more time after midnight."
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,Medford_LMT,"Significantly better than before Duolingo. I'm in section 4 of Spanish. I also listen to the Duolingo Spanish app, music in Spanish, and I read Spanish baby books to my baby. I am definitely not fluent, but I'm at a level where I am way more comfortable trying to speak Spanish with someone than a year and a half ago. 

If you use Duolingo as your only educational source then all you're going to do is memorize words/sentences. It really should be one of many things you do to try to learn when you're not able to immerse yourself in the language natively, and I feel that way even if you were to be taking real Spanish classes. I took Spanish 1 & 2 at my local community college and it was, for the most part, all stuff I had already learned from Duolingo. 

(also btw I saw someone said Duolingo doesn't teach grammar. this isn't true. Duolingo has always had grammar explanations for as long as I can remember, and my account was created in 2013 I believe.  They've now also added grammar concept lessons which I have personally found useful)."
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,Iambeejsmit,I'm at 1371 days and yes I can speak and understand the language a bit.  I use it sometimes when I'm working (Spanish).  Probably only 2-300 of those days are genuinely studying with the rest of them being just doing a lesson or two.
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,littlefoxwriter,"I started using Duolingo when I was already at a mid-beginner level in Korean (about 80 hrs of classes). I find that it's a good review tool and has taught me some new vocabulary and sentence/phrase structures. I tested into the middle of section 2. I have another app I do speaking with, so I wish I could turn off speaking practice in Duolingo and have it focus more on listening, which is my weakest area."
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,non_moose,"700+ days here: 
No not at all. For the most part I just do 5 minutes a day to keep the streak going which just isn't enough. It does a rubbish job explaining grammar so most of that it guess work for me. 
I learned the most at the start when I was doing half an hour a day and putting effort in.
The way I see it though is my vocabulary and knowledge is slowly slowly building and if I got serious about learning it I'd have a head start."
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,Alex_Yuan,"I'd say it's working like it's supposed to. When I was crashing German, before Duolingo existed, I put in 5 hour+ a day consistently and got from A1 to very fluent C1 in a year (1800 hours+ in total). That's almost learning and practicing German full-time. Now I'm on a 1800+ day streak learning Spanish on Duolingo, averaging 5 minutes a day (150 - 200 hours total), and I'm at A2 probably. So I'd say Duolingo is definitely not worse than learning a language the traditional way. It's not magic, you've got to put in the hours."

You are absolutely right, using *only* Duolingo to learn Japanese would be very confusing and counterproductive.

I try to watch anime in original dub, to ""soak up"" the language in a more natural way. But truth be told, despite how so many people seem to hate AI, I've learned quite a lot from Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Perplexity - at least on the beginner level, I think it can be used as a language consultant/teacher. Duolingo is more structured but lacks in explanations, I think these approaches complement each other quite well.

edit: note that this is true for almost any approach to learning a language. unless you're a genius with grammar and have an excellent memory for vocab, you're going to need to spend more than a couple hours a week casually flipping through flash cards or doing workbook exercises. think about how babies and children learn their first language and try to replicate that as closely as possible.


I say this as someone with a degree in linguistics who's maybe not a genius with grammar but who generally excelled in that respect, only to learn way too late that I have absolutely shit memory for vocab."

Duolingo had a thriving community who were actively involved in helping to expand the existing courses and build new ones, along with a huge web forum full of invaluable linguistic discussions going back whatever it was – 8 years? 10 years? And in addition to allowing you to to see (and join in on) the separate threads of community discussion under specific questions, the app even used to include sections that – get this – _clearly laid out grammatical rules_, including full conjugation tables, in an easy-to-digest format.

The gamification was always an element of the app, but it wasn’t until the last 4 years or so, IIRC, that they burned down almost everything that had made it a good learning experience and reduced it to being nothing _but_ a game.

But I tried learning in school, then I tried on my own back in the early ‘00s with flash cards, workbooks; and audiotapes. Nothing ever stuck and I just got bogged down until I quit. 

Using Duolingo actually *does* teach you vocabulary and grammar. I can pick up an easy French reader and understand most of it now, which is way more than I could do before. While I’m under zero delusions that I’m anything close to conversational, my goal is less to be conversationally fluent and more to eventually able to read books in French.

Every section has multiple units, and every unit is divided up into “steps” with multiple “lessons”. The first step of each unit  is devoted to new vocabulary. The grammar just gets thrown in.

For me, the frustration with Duolingo is that you have to pay to have a functional app that allows you to learn well. To have access to explanations on why you got something wrong, you have to pay even more to be in the top-tier payment plan. It teaches you languages but you will pay money for it (and to be fair, you’d pay money for lessons, classes, self-teaching books, etc. too).

And “décevoir” is 100% a verb that has been taught to me haha. This person probably just hit a review section, got bored, and quit instead of continuing on and now thinks the review section was the end."

They need lessons spaced throughout where they introduce grammar. For example, early on there should be a chapter about verb conjugation if that applies to the language you're learning. Then in a later chapter they should get to tenses.

As an example, if you have a mandarin speaking friend, get them to speak to you in mandarin where the word remains the same but based on intonation, it can change meanings. They will tell you the same word 4 times, but those 4 same words can have different meaning based on how they intone it.

WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,needlzor,"I looked into this before and what I found was - learn basic grammar and some basic vocabulary with a flashcard app (lot of people seem to like anki but there are specialised ones) and buy some graded readers (books written with a specific vocabulary sheet) and practice reading them. Actually reading them, not just deciphering them. 

Once you've got some bases, use an app like Tandem (not sure if that's still active, it was all the rage when I was deep into languages) to find a language partner to practice with (if you're a woman or presenting as such, prepare to fend off a lot of creeps to use those platforms to find dates, at least according to some of the people I chatted with). If you live in a city you might have some language cafes or language learning clubs nearby.

Also, if you can afford it, getting a language tutor is great on top of all of that. I took language classes as a group and also got some 1:1 tutoring and I feel like I covered as much in 10 weeks of 1:1 tutoring as I did in 20 weeks of group classes."

WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,FUBARded,"Agreed.

I did a lot of French and a little Spanish in secondary school. I lost what little French proficiency I had within probably a year of not practicing, but Duolingo allowed me to regain most of it and develop my Spanish a little beyond where I left it in school.

I'm really far from being able to speak either language and I can only understand simpler sentences spoken slowly, but I can read both to a decent level.

Basically, I think you really need traditional education in grammar and syntax before going into Duolingo for it to be useful, and if you actually want to develop fluency in the spoken language you need to do a lot more speaking and listening practice than it prompts.

I'm well aware that the bare minimum I'm putting in now isn't really making me better, but for me it's enough to just maintain what I have and the 1-3 minutes a day is surprisingly useful for that."

That way you can passively learn how the language works. Some people also just have a talent for languages and pick up on grammar without knowing it. 
Reading books that are appropriate for the vocabulary you learnt helps a lot more than just studying random phrases without much context. You can get a feeling for the language.

And if you reallly want to learn how to speak. Choose a book with an audiobook version and read aloud and record yourself. That way you can pick up on enunciation and the pronunciation of the consonants and vowels much better, especially when they are foreign to your first language."

WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,Hans_S0L0,"I agree that Duolingo’s profit motives are driving these changes. I don’t think it’s just about cutting costs or efficiency. They take anti consumer policies. Moreover companies make strategic decisions to dismantle communities when those communities no longer align with their evolving business models. The Couchsurfing example isn’t just a conspiracy. It’s an example of how a platform’s focus can shift dramatically when new owners see more value in a different direction. It’s possible Duolingo is making similar moves, deliberately changing their platform in ways that prioritize profit over community, even if it means alienating loyal users."

It's like how Americans, Brits, Australians, Jamaicans, South Africans, etc. can communicate with each other just fine even though we use some different words, phrases and accents. We can understand what they are saying, but still recognize that we are not from the same place. People from Spain and people from Cuba can converse with each other and understand the whole time just like an American can with an Aussie in English. You could realistically learn British English, then go to canada speaking the Kings and no one would think different, they would just hear a foreigner speaking english, without even realizing they're imposing a British dialect. I likely would've gotten the same reactions in Spain. They would just hear a foreigner speaking Spanish in such an infant state that there isn't a noticeable dialect in particular being used and there would really be no determining where I learned it."
WTH is wrong with the Duolingo marketing department?,ServeAlone7622,https://i.redd.it/vxfwm822fqld1.jpeg,deebville86ed,"It's funny you say that. Last year I used duolingo to try to brush up on Spanish for a trip to Chile and Peru, only to get there and realize the Spanish you hear on duolingo and the Spanish you hear in real life, especially with it's varying dialects in South America, are NOT the same thing. I believe they give you traditional Spanish lessons on duolingo. The only place that would be useful in the America's would probably be Argentina. The way a Spaniard speaks in comparison to how, say, a Dominican speaks are very very different. Sure, it's the same language, but it's like a Brit trying to understand a Cajun from the bayous of Louisiana. They're very different dialects. I was getting sideways looks every time I tried to apply it. Plus duolingo just doesn't teach you much that you will actually need to use in real life conversation with strangers. 

The only way to actually learn a language is to be a toddler or fully immerse yourself in it. You'd be better off learning from your husband. Start watching some Spanish programming, have him teach you some vocabulary. Worry about the conjugations and everything else later. It'll start to make more sense as you expand your vocabulary. Think of the most crucial things you say in your native tongue and learn them in spanish. It'll take just as much time and be a lot more beneficial than learning how to say ""the young man is from China"" and other random trivial phrases on what's basically a flashcard app. Trust me. Duolingo is a waste of time"

Take German for example. Using Duo you can learn a solid foundation of words, phrases and “get around language”, but lacks any grammar instruction. Buy a 7 dollar book on Amazon, German grammar instruction and read it.

Want to become conversational? There are tutors you can hire online or locally, you need to speak it to learn it. There are discord servers to immerse yourself in, listen read and watch their media.

I was able to pick up most of the rules for German using their method, but that involved a lot of trial and error until I had the moment where it clicked. Now, I don't see that happening. So I uninstalled the app, switched over to Babbel *and* bought their lifetime sub. It turns out that having explanations of why articles change, and little tooltips that explain why you're making the same mistake over and over are helpful! Go figure!

I encourage all of you on the fence to delete the app. Enshittification comes for everything these days, but that doesn't mean you have to be beholden to these companies."

It's purely a spaced repetition vocab app where you're required to be objective.

By default, you get shown a word and have ~60 seconds. You can say you didn't recall it, you had trouble, it took a second, or it was easy. 

Your answer determines how quickly you'll be shown the card again (if you failed, you'll see it again within a minute, if it was easy, you'll answer again in a day, etc.)


If you can be hyper objective when studying (aka NOT saying ""oh I knew that kanji"" after being shown the meaning), it's essentially the best possible way to learn and retain vocab quickly.


Grammar wise, keep it simple. You can use a site like tofugu, but it's lacking imo. Genki is possible (but much harder) without a tutor/teacher). Sethclydesdale's GitHub has a multiple choice test for every section of genki, so it's a decent entry in.


 Genki can take as little as a month if you're insanely dedicated *and* talented, or you can go a more average route (I believe colleges take 2 semesters to finish genki 1).


After, you ideally move to a textbook such as Tobira or Quarter (quartet is a continuation of genki, but assumes a bit of study between). Just a heads up, both books are a *big* step up from genki in difficulty and density.



As a last step, *do not* use Living Language. It was how I started and quite possibly the slowest and least efficient textbook I've used."

Access is free. All content is accessible. 

But progress is going to be slow for non-paid users, especially if you make lots of mistakes.

You do understand that millions of people using an app for 30+ minutes a day would have extremely high server costs associated with it right? By limiting how long free users spend on the app through the heart system reduces server load costs and it is the only way they can maintain profitability (they would lose much of their profit on AWS fees otherwise). 

Them being profitable is what allows them to keep giving you and others free access.

Duo owes us nothing 
And we owe Duo nothing. 

It's a choice, driven by market forces. On both sides.

Ultimately, it's a tranaction. Duo has something to give (a service). And we have some to give in return (monetary consideration).

It's a tranaction. Both sides give, and both sides receive.

Personally, I believe that the Duolingo app is one of the best apps I've ever used, so I pay for the family version of Super Duo. I don't get paid for it; and I shouldn't be. I'm compensated fairly by what it provides in return.

A big part of an academic CV is the ability to get research published in a high-impact journal however you have to pay to get stuff published and those high impact journals are more expensive and because it is based around the US dollars, people from globally less wealthy countries are less able to afford it because the currency is weaker to the point where the cost of publishing one paper in these journals is about the same as the salary for a postdoc for a year. Therefore, even though their research may be as good or better than that seen in a higher impact journal, their CV looks weaker because they weren't able to afford to publish it there.

I could understand if they made a cheaper option, lacking some of the premium features, but adding a tier and taking away features we already had in premium? No thats gross and not okay..

It's no worse than what any other company is doing. All tech companies had a VC funded free-ride for a long time. That has come to an end. These companies need to do what they need to do to survive.

There's something to be said for companies that take advantage and gouge customers. Duolingo isn't doing that IMO.

All the people shouting ""Education should be free"" are out of touch. Education IS free, there are a million online resources, or youtube videos. But running a platform like duolingo has built is expensive as hell. And now that VC funds have run out they need to make money or die.

Check out your local library network to see if they offer any language programs. Mine has MangoLanguages which is normally $24/month but I’m using it for free thanks to my library card. Its significantly better than Duolingo as it actually teaches grammar concepts and uses memory science to help you better retain the information you learn. Each of its corses (theres like 15-20 of them) are entirely made, and even voiced(or at least German is), by actual native speakers. Your library network may have something similar on offer so I’d strongly recommend checking it out"

Now: Finishing a unit gives gems, finishing daily quests all give XP boost in increasing multiplier. The multiplier seems to differ for each person but I think every chest gives you 10 minutes boost for a total of 30 minutes..

Previously: Finishing a unit gave you 15 minutes 2x XP boost, finishing the bronze and silver daily quest gave you gems. Gold gave you XP boost 15 minutes 2x XP boost right before the current system, but before that it also gave you gems.

The current system only gives you 1 hour of boost unless you extend it with gems, but in practice to make best use of the boost, you'll have to do it like this: claim the chest in the morning, finish the 3 quests. This gives you 45 minutes of 2x-3x boost. That contiguous chunk of 45 minutes is problematic, I can't usually spare that much time in one go, I'd rather spread it through the day but there's no incentive to start a lesson until the evening for another chest.

With the previous system, or preferable the one before that, I just need to spare 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening. Then I can just claim extra 15 minutes XP boost from finishing a unit at any convenient time.

Of course a long time ago there was no XP boosts, and finishing a unit didn't give you anything. In theory I could just pretend there were no XP boosts but Duo has rewired my brain to seek that. I'm playing it the way they intended and doing it otherwise defeats the purpose of using the app.

I think it would be better if we can just stock up XP boosts that we can buy and/or claim at any time. The current system either forces you to use the boost now, or only offer extensions."

I finished Duolingo! What now?,DragonOfEmpire,https://i.redd.it/k1l8cqg0u4dd1.jpeg,ReflectionImportant2,"So I also recently finished Duolingo and in December last year I took a B1 exam (and passed). My strategy now for learning things is by trying to make my life as Italian as possible, so that is reading news (I use the Sky News Italia app “Sky TG24” for news, as well as watching TV as at least in the UK there is an app called Globo TV that lets you watch Rai channels! I also have even changed things like my Call of Duty into Italian so I’m even learning that kind of vocab now too hahaha).

I’m the same as you where I need to gameify things for me to learn quicker so I use an app called Quizlet and I aim to learn approx 50 words a week. So I collect words on my notes app during the week and then I add them to a “set” on Quizlet and use that to help memorise them. It’s not perfect because unless you apply all these words in conversation or see it in text often enough, you may not retain all of them, but it’s been helpful for me to increase my vocab!

Hope that’s helpful!"

Since you're looking for a more repetitive and structured way to learn vocabulary, Clozemaster is a great next step. It helps you practice words in context and lets you see sentences, which is really helpful for remembering how to use them.

You might also want to try Anki for flashcards. It's free and lets you create your own decks, so you can focus on specific topics like fruits, vegetables, or verbs. You can find pre-made decks online, too, which saves time.

Another option is Memrise, which uses spaced repetition and offers a variety of vocabulary courses. It’s also designed to keep you engaged while helping you learn effectively.

To build your vocabulary even further, consider labeling things around your home with sticky notes in Italian. This constant exposure can help reinforce your learning.

You can also listen to podcasts focused on vocabulary or short stories, like “Coffee Break Italian.” This way, you can hear how words are used in context while still getting that repetition.

Lastly, don’t hesitate to keep engaging with the Italian community here on Reddit. Sharing your progress and asking questions can really help you stay motivated. Enjoy your learning journey!"

Sinceramente? Puoi anche imparare tutti i sinonimi, parole e verbi che vuoi ma se non ascolterai mai o in generale non utilizzerai mai l'italiano è veramente difficile che tu inizi a suonare naturale. Anzi, cercando di imparare parole meno comuni c'è il rischio di suonare peggio e troppo ""impostati"" o ""aulici"". Ti consiglio di guardare video su YouTube in italiano di temi che ti interessano, se la velocità è un problema puoi ridurla su YouTube. Oppure messaggiare con qualche madrelingua in maniera ""casual"".

I was in section 4, continuing to do units, and the update stopped me in my tracks and gave me this screen. It says to do a daily refresh, rather than teaching me anything new. Duolingo's updates have been annoying in the past, changing how far along you are, doubling the units by splitting their sections, but this was a new low"
I finished Duolingo! What now?,DragonOfEmpire,https://i.redd.it/k1l8cqg0u4dd1.jpeg,Competitive_Flow231,"Great job on sticking with learning! That's probably the hardest thing about it!

After you pat yourself on the back, check to see where you feel your weaknesses are. The most likely answer to this will probably be ""Well I'm pretty comfortable reading, solving exercises, writing a text to a certain degree"", depending on what your goal was initially you're already and have achieved it!

However, if your goal was to be able to speak, I think you can now move on to get speaking practice.  Ideas there would be getting a language teacher or a tandem ( expensive \[in the case of teacher\], scheduling hassle) or playing around with ChatGPT to hold some conversation in basic Italian (Try something like: ""Hold a basic conversation with me in Italian"" and change to voice mode). I'd highly recommend you do that and see how you like it. Potentially ChatGPT already scratches that itch of speaking practice.  
There are also specific AI language learning apps that provide some more quality-of-life features to ChatGPT. I'm biased on this one, but I'd recommend using \*[Univerbal](http://univerbal.app)\*. For my Greek practice it worked wonders, since I get instant correction (which can also be a bit depressing sometimes) for everything I say...but the main benefit I think is simple to get all the speaking practice out. I think of it similar to the 10'000h rule, so to become conversationally fluent I just need to speak X'000h in that language, how can I do that in the most efficient way?

Your answer might vary to mine, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  
Disclosure: I work at univerbal...so I'm a bit biased on this one."

Like you in that longer Italian post I only did not know the 2 words in quotes. 

I also watched the learning YouTube for Stefano, as well as Lucrezia and the school in Verona with Giacomo and the two women (Studio Italiano in Classe). I can understand almost all of them with less knowledge for the latter one since it is a bit quicker as they are talking to each other. 

The Facebook reels I am watching can be very hard to follow but fun at times. 

I tried two lessons so far in Italki. It is challenging to do it in real time without that guide. 

Some people suggest Anki decks or something on AI to just keep drilling the weak spots. Have not tried that yet. 

Two things that could still be a challenge in Duo First are the timed challenges. They come up every other time in rotation with the word match. It pushes you to not rely on any translation or mull over the sentence for a minute. Also going back and doing units in Legendary mode. It gives you harder sentences and you can’t look at the words."

It's an app where you play through thousands of fill-in-the-blank sentences to expand your Italian vocabulary fast. I think it checks a decent number of the boxes you mentioned

- It's specifically meant for intermediate learners / after or alongside playing Duolingo.
- The goal is to expand your vocabulary.
- It has thousands of sentences so you can learn new words everyday.
- It uses a spaced repetition system so you get lots of repetition.
- It's fill-in-the-blank, so you're always seeing the vocab in context.
- Not quite by topic, but it does have sentences grouped roughly by most common words, so you can jump in to your level.
- It's definitely grindy (the new Fast Track collections total 10,000 sentences) and it's all about tracking your progress.

You can download pre-made decks for Italian (like specific ones for verbs, fruits, etc.), or create your own if you’re feeling ambitious. Plus, it’s free!

If you want vocab in context like Duolingo, try Clozemaster. It’s all about learning vocab through sentences, so you’re not just memorizing random words. It’s repetitive, has different topics, and you can even focus on grammar or common phrases.

Essentially, it is not difficult for me to translate a sentence from english to italian if I know all the words, but when I'm having conversations with italians, my sentences feel ""too english"" or maybe even a bit too formal at times, which makes them sound a bit weird and not natural, but I guess it is something expected after mainly doing duolingo.

Finalmente, dopo 412 giorni, ho finito il intero corso di italiano sul duolingo. Beh, forse non intero, perchè c'erano qualche aggiornamento al corso, quindi non ho finito ogni capitolo che esista ora, ma ho finito ogni capitolo che esistava quando ho iniziato a fare Duolingo.

Generalmente, credo che sia stata una brava esperienza e sinceramente, dubbio che potessi imparare così tanto così velocemente da qualunque altra cosa. Consiglio Duolingo a chiunque chi vuole imparare italiano, specialmente principianti, perchè duolingo insegna italiano molto lentamente, ma alla fine conosci molte cose importante della lingua italiana. Tuttavia, forse non è una sorpresa che sia necessario usare qualche altra cosa per aiutarti a imparare italiano se non capisci ogni regola grammaticale, perchè duolingo non le spiega troppo bene. Do a duolingo un 8.5/10, perchè può essere un po' noioso a volte.

Comunque, ora voglio venire alla parte più importante di questo post, ed è la domanda: Come posso continuare a imparare l'italiano? Sono stato in questo subreddit da parecchio tempo, ed ho visto tanti consigli, per esempio leggere libri, guardare film, etc. Anche se credo che siano modi utili per imparare l'italiano, non penso che siano davvero per me. Io preferisco un modo più repetitivo per studiare una lingua (è perche mi piaceva duolingo così tanto). Forse qualcosa dove potrò vedere quale parole e frasi ho già imparato. Ancora credo che dovrò imparare tantissime nuove parole e verbi, quindi preferirei qualcosa con cuì potrò imparare molte nuove parole. (Qui il linguaggio del mio post si è diventato troppo difficile e non riesco a tradurrlo di più, è davvero troppo difficile per qualcuno chi ha solo usato duolingo💀)

Comunque, conoscete alcuni applicazioni/risorse per imparare l'italiano, specialmente quei che insegnano tanto vocabolario? Preferirei risorse gratuite. Grazie

I generally consider being able to speak a language, rather being able to message with others in that language than actually speaking, as I dont generally even speak in english often. With that kept in mind, while messaging others is a good way to improve, as it will help me be more fluent, I feel like its also needed to have a vocabulary learning app besides that. It sometimes happens to me, that I wanna say a sentence in italian, and I can just barely say it except... I dont know a word/verb. That is just super frustrating and this is why I'm putting such emphasis on finding something which will improve my vocabulary.
Anyway, thank you for the suggestion and kind words!"

I'm doing the ""complete"" course, rather than the ""for travel"" course. It has 4 units (A1 through B2), each divided into 20-30 chapters, with each chapter having 4-5 lessons and a ""checkpoint"" requiring 80% to advance. Each lesson feels shorter than Duo's but they're similar with a mix of multiple choice, writing, and speaking exercises. But the spoken examples include actual video of real people instead of Duo's computer generated audio. There is also a review section that I haven't dug into much yet but it looks more meaty than Duo's. 

The weekly challenges include simple translations, open ended questions (like ""describe your daily routine""), images to describe, and speaking exercises that are almost tongue twisters (one of this week's is ""Guglielmo coglie ghiaia dagli scogli scagliandola oltre gli scogli tra mille gorgogli""). The challenges can all be written or spoken (except the spoken only one), and are all judged by native speakers. You're kind of at the mercy of the community, but I think I've had all of mine reviewed by at least one other person.

So I tried Busuu after finishing it, and it was... humbling. A lot of household, daily vocabulary was completely missing, it has longer listening exercises with real speakers, and it feels like holding on for dear life if you've only heard Duo's text-to-speech examples. The sad truth is that Duo's course isn't about helping you get a good and complete education, it's stretching out its content in a way to make you feel like you're accomplishing something but is mostly repetition. 

A lot of people recommend listening to podcasts, TV, movies etc to get more immersed, and that will likely help as well."

Finally got the advice that I gotta be doing some proper listening, listened to a podcast in slow Italian for learners and I understood maybe 3 words lol. I went from being a defender of Duolingo to uninstalling it that day and haven't missed it😂 Thankfully I've improved my listening massive amounts since then, but if I could do it all over again I would've started doing immersion with podcasts and YouTube videos etc on day one. Duolingo has a really terrible way of misleading you into thinking you're better than you are and that using other things is almost a waste, anything to get super subscribers and ad revenue.

Also, maybe I didn't quite *only* use duolingo throughout the 412 days, but its most of it, lets say the proportion is 25:1 duolingo to other sources.

But yeah, Duolingo was definitely my main way of learning, and I hope my entire text shows that duolingo is not actually that bad, even if there are mistakes :).

Has anyone ever actually learned a language through Duolingo?,thunderstorm0508,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1d8vywi/has_anyone_ever_actually_learned_a_language/,Devilnaht,"I'll try and answer the deeper question here, which is ""Does Duolingo work / is it a good tool?"" My views on Duolingo have changed periodically as I've gotten further in my own language learning, and they've grown progressively more negative. At this point, I would recommend Duolingo to people only in very specific circumstances: there are some very small languages on Duolingo that have almost no other resources for learners, and in those cases, Duolingo does provide a worthwhile benefit.

Outside of that, however, speaking as someone who spent a good amount of time trying to use Duolingo before swapping to other methods, its weaknesses are many and grave. It moves at a torturously slow pace, both in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Many of its typical 'lessons' bear no resemblance to real world use of the language, and do not prepare you for it (selecting and ordering word bubbles, for example, or rejecting alternative ways of conveying an idea). They also tend to heavily emphasize a kind of literal translation which is quite harmful in the longer term; non-English languages aren't just English phrases with words swapped out in a different order. Those I've met who relied heavily or exclusively on Duolingo invariably ended up with very weak to non-existent speaking and listening abilities (and with frighteningly bad pronunciation). 

To which the typical response is, ""Well, it's only meant to be a supplement to other activities, not a primary tool. This isn't judging it in the appropriate context."" First, the reality is that most of its users \*do\* view it as a primary learning method, and nothing in Duolingo's marketing presents it as 'a supplementary tool alongside other methods'. Its current tagline on the app store is ""Learn a new language with the world’s most-downloaded education app!"", and includes the line ""Duolingo works. Designed by learning experts, Duolingo has a science-based teaching methodology proven to foster long-term knowledge retention."" Most users are going to think you can learn a language just through Duolingo, and Duolingo does everything it can to reinforce this belief.

Second, even viewed through that perspective as a supplemental tool, the fact is that it just... sucks. At best, it's wildly inefficient (with 3 months of heavy usage I hadn't even reached the past tense!), and at worst, trains and reinforces faulty, unnatural patterns. 

And therein lies my largest issue with Duolingo: its opportunity cost. People using Duolingo \*feel\* like they're doing something, like they're working to learn a language, like they just need to keep going with it and eventually they'll get there. And when, inevitably, despite having spent 300 hours and 3 years on the app, they can do almost nothing with the language, they give up on it, perhaps even blaming themselves."
Has anyone ever actually learned a language through Duolingo?,thunderstorm0508,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1d8vywi/has_anyone_ever_actually_learned_a_language/,La_Nuit_Americaine,"I think the short answer will be no -- and the long answer will be, yes, with caveats.

Nobody learns a language with one method only, so the answer is no. 

To the extent that one would really heavily on one method only, Duolingo would be ineffective at providing the volume of knowledge needed to truly ""know"" a language, so the answer again, is no.

But, I bet there are a lot of people who started out on Duolingo, got some basics, but then moved onto other, more effective, more intense methods and did end up becoming fluent, so in that sense, Duolingo, as an introduction to a language, or secondary practice app could be part of that process.

The only real success stories I hear with Duolingo are from people who live in country and start with Duo, but it's just there to help their immersion that's happening anyway -- and similarly from people who are married to a foreigner, and Duo is there to help with a similar immersive studying with their partner. 

As a solo method, Duo will not get you far.

The way I put it is that Duolingo won't get you conversational or able to watch and understand French media, but it will get you to the point where you can get those skills by doing them.

Now can he speak English? No. He is a A2 at best because he never uses it. He only uses Duolingo and Duolingo is not real life where you speak to people.

As far as I know Duolingo opts for a level like B1. And as somebody else already stated, as a supplementary resource Duolingo is great. Just dont rely solely on 1 resource, in general."

It's only conversational language though so mostly like... what you need to get by... small talk... shopping... travel... hobbies... etc. It's enough to get you into slice-of-life genre shows or even games like Pokemon or Mario... but that's about the limit.

From there though it hasn't been terrible building up other vocabulary on my own, as surface conversational language is sort of the foundation of everything else. So the gaps tend to be small... still enough to require you to stop and look up words as you go... but it's generally just a couple words per sentence. (or what you're looking at is WAAYYY too hard).

It's been enough that I can in fact read news headlines on different topics. My phone is in Japanese so I get the occasional Japanese google headline. Todays is

100人も子供がいた古代エジプトの王様。その棺にまつわる謎とは？

A King of Ancient Egypt who had 100 children.  What is the mystery that surrounds this coffin.\*

\*Coffin, surround, and mystery (棺, まつわる, 謎) were unknown words to me.

I have another one saved in my phone but it's not particularly difficult by any means:

エベレストでケニア人死亡

Kenyan dies on Everest.

Last actual article I read was about a train stabbing. I could understand enough of it to get a clear picture of what happened, but there were some small details that I missed because of unknown words. That was a couple years ago so it's just gotten easier since then. I can play several games now even with unknown vocabulary and either parse them from context or have them be negligible...... that's still been a lot of post-duolingo footwork... but its like 99% vocabulary gathering.  
  
Honestly I never even finished the Duolingo course.  
  
I also do the German Duolingo course... not with as much fervor and consistency but it's been enough to start understanding songs I didn't understand before. (barbaras rhabarberbar doesn't count. I can only catch ""kuchen"" and that it's bombastic.)  
  
TL:DR - you can potentially get quite a bit from it, but after you outgrow it you'll still have quite a bit you have to do on your own. It can be a pretty good foundation though."

Yes. I started studying Spanish with Duo in 2021.

Duolingo says I'm on A2 level. Of course, that's probably not true. 🤣

***

I make a lot of grammar mistakes (and have to check with Google Translate)! I find Duo very good in maintaining one's discipline because all it takes, truly, is to inject the language you want to learn in your schedules every day. It makes the language ""second-nature"" even if you don't have anyone to converse with (I don't have any). I'm basically self-studying, and I bought a Spanish dictionary and grammar book along with a workbook and an A1 preparation book to help me 🥰 But Duo has been so HELPFUL because I have ADHD tendencies and the way they structure lessons encourage me to learn! I especially love the Story Time and ""Radio Shows"" the best because we learn to create sentences at the end of the story and my ability to understand only by hearing is tested by the radio shows. 

I once was so discouraged by Spanish (even if I literally live in a country where our language has Spanish words) because it is so hard, especially sentence construction, and Duolingo is definitely helpful for me!"

I think it maybe can be done with actual classes but those typically also include reading literature and watching films as homework.

True proficiency can only be unlocked by actually engaging with the language in a real environment I feel. A class can perhaps simulate that adequately but textbooks can only bring one to the level that engaging with a real environment to further hone one's skill to true proficiency becomes possible.

Duolingo simply does not go far enough and one will quickly notice that the real way people use languages is often not covered by textbooks and people use all sorts of constructs and phrasings the textbook simply forgot to include. Like how many textbooks about Dutch will teach one about “Zal wel gast.” It means something like “Whatever mate."". Just like “Whatever mate.” in English its an indispensible part of knowing Dutch, it's meaning is not really transparent for people that don't know of it, but it doesn't feel like something a textbook would cover either. I don't even think this use of “gast” will be covered by it easily but dictionaries will probably list it. Textbooks will only use this word literally to mean “guest”, but it has a secondary usage as a form of address which has a similar vibe to using “mate” or “dude” in English."

Has anyone ever actually learned a language through Duolingo?,thunderstorm0508,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1d8vywi/has_anyone_ever_actually_learned_a_language/,SpanishLearnerUSA,"I've spent the past six months looking for the magic all-in-one program that would teach me Spanish fast. It doesn't exist. I haven't found a single person who became fluent with any of the popular online programs. The only one with a religious following of people saying it works is Dreaming Spanish, but....

1. Every person I've seen who reached the conversational level with Dreaming Spanish did so after supplementing with outside reading and conversation practice. If you are motivated enough to embark on their 1,500 hour journey, you clearly are all-in and willing to dedicate the extra time to reading and speaking. The vast majority pay for speaking classes. 

2. Dreaming Spanish is 1,500 hours plus reading and speaking practice, while someone can finish Duolingo in far less time. I estimated that I could finish Duo  in 900 hours. If I spent the next 600 hours after that reading and working with a speaking partner/tutor, I'm pretty sure that I'd be conversational. 

3. The vast majority of people who start Duolingo have the follow-through of a flea. They think they can learn the language in a few months while practicing 5 minutes a day. On the other hand, Dreaming Spanish attracts more hardcore learners. 

4. Most Dreaming Spanish users had a lot of previous Spanish exposure. They didn't start at zero. 

But to me, here's the big difference. Duolingo is boring. Most people can't maintain the pace long enough to complete the course. The beauty of Dreaming Spanish is that you are learning while doing things (watching videos, listening to podcasts) that you'd do anyway. I do a bit of Duolingo every day, but the vast majority of my Spanish time is spent listening to podcasts and scrolling Spanish social media. It doesn't feel like work. 

So, can you learn Spanish with Duolingo? Sure. You can get pretty close to being conversational. But it's a slog."

I also used it for Spanish since I learned it off the streets and really needed to learn the grammar. took me about ... 6 months, helped a lot. 

that being said, I feel like Duolingo back then had a lot less fluff, advertisements and time-consuming animations. I tried it again last year and it just annoyed me."

My uncle is on a 7yr streak with Japanese on Duolingo (which is definitely impressive) but he can't string a sentence together that isn't incredibly basic. He doesn't understand when my husband and I (he is Japanese and I'm fluent) are talking in Japanese except for picking out the odd word. My mum uses Duolingo to supplement her Irish language studies.

I probably spent less than an hour on the platform. 

I checked out ""Esperanto: Learning and Using the International Language"" from my local library, and I skimmed through it. That was arguably important, because it included the correlatives table, and I really liked that way of learning those words - the Duolingo course just teaches them one at a time. However, in the grand scheme of learning the language, the handful of correlatives, while important, are not that big. If I'm being generous, I think I spent about 4-5 hours with that book in the couple of weeks I had it.

I was using the Duolingo Forums to augment my learning on that platform - which is arguably outside of Duolingo, and it doesn't even exist anymore. I probably spent 20-30 hours on there over the course of the 8 months I was studying.

I was religious about doing my Duolingo lessons when I was learning Esperanto. I maintained a streak for over 8 months, doing a minimum of 3 lessons a day, but sometimes doing dozens of lessons. I probably studied for 80-100 hours on Duolingo in that time, so it was certainly the lion's share of my time studying the language.

If you don't count the Duolingo Forums, then I guess I didn't really learn Esperanto using exclusively Duolingo. If you do count them, you can point to my use of that one book as being an outside resource, but while I will credit it for helping me tremendously with correlatives, by the time I found it, it mainly was review for me of what I had already been learning in Duolingo.

Esperanto as a community is a very unique experience. You will never find people more willing to work with inexperienced speakers of their language. Even among the native Esperanto speakers, this is usually the case, as the history of the language is taught to them as they grow up, and the philosophy behind it is going to be instilled into them by their parents."

Being able to speak a single language well in a year typically requires a pretty considerable commitment. I dunno, it's a lot of time but it's keeping her mind active and if she's still getting around and carrying on with her life, it seems like it's good to have something to focus on.   
  
But yeah, if she's willing to put in that much time and make that much progress, she'd probably do well to pick up some other programs to hone her abilities beyond what Duolingo provides and she'd probably do well to pick 2 or 3 favorites and focus her energies there as deep learning is pretty impossible when her focus is that scattered."

Chess has long been considered among the best “whole brain” activities. The caveat is you need to play the old-fashioned way with an actual chessboard, and not on a computer. Playing on a phone or computer removes the added visuospatial dynamic which is key.

If she is as active in learning and enjoys it as much as you suggest, continuing education courses may be a good way to initiate learning as well.

It helps you read in other languages. Basically it is a reading app where you can tap a word or sentence to translate it.

You can upload your own files as well, so you can also download ebooks in other languages and upload them.

That would also bridge the gap into other activities like audiobooks, podcasts and reading the old fashioned way in other languages.

But all those things have less gamification, so I don't know if they would be interesting to her. But you did say she liked reading before.

(Also note about Linq specifically, it is a little tedious at first, since it tries to keep track of every word you know, so it is a lot of tapping on filler words, but I promise it gets much closer to normal reading quickly)"

Yeah, because Duolingo doesn’t teach speaking. The most it ever has you say is a single sentence, and it doesn’t actually care if you say it right. You never have to generate a sentence from scratch and get it out of your face in real time.

My degree is in French, but since I live in the middle of the US, I don't get many opportunities to immerse myself to keep my fluency up. 
My oldest moved to Italy years ago, so I started using Duo to learn some basics. 
A month ago, I started the French section. I spend a minimum of two hours on lessons and practice each day. One hour in the morning, another in the evening. I'm competitive, so if I'm in an overachieving league, I'm right in the thick of it. 
I have noticed my listening and reading comprehension are improving. I watched a documentary earlier this week, French with English subtitles. I was able to understand most of what was being said, as there was a delay in the subtitles appearing. 
Your mom may understand more than what you're perceiving. Even if she isn't, this is helping her brain to flex. I would suggest you encourage her to add the music section, too. I haven't tried the math yet, so I can't speak to that. But music, math, and language are all connected.
Does she have any interest in learning and practicing her languages in other ways? Streaming services are brimming with foreign language options. Podcasts, TikTok, Instagram could be fun, too. 
I hope you get to keep your mom for a long as possible. I know what it's like to have a parent who isn't *my* parent anymore. You're mourning a loss while they're sitting right next to you."

The moment she falls into a pattern of wrote repetition/familiarity, is the moment she loses the benefit from the activity (unless it’s regular walks and exercise at a meaningful rate/intensity). 

Is there a local embassy, language learning center, or college nearby? The more she pushes herself to face the unfamiliar, theoretically, the less likely (it’s not a guarantee) she will be as deeply affected by AD.

Is there a particular language she is more interested in? She should be encouraged to pick one and get back into reading but this time in that language, and to also look into other methods of language learning, particularly speaking practice.

Using Duolingo to keep the brain active is a good idea, but now that she's memorised it and is doing everything by rote it will have lost a lot of its efficacy, it's not really excercising the brain muscle in the same way that learning something new does, but going deeper into a language absolutely will. I suspect it's not something that gets recommended very often as most people lack the motivation to actually learn a new language in later life but your mother sounds like she could be the exception that proves the rule.

I’m pretty sure that the only reason why I keep at it is because of my streak and that is a silly reason.  I’m looking for a new way to approach my learning because this just isn’t working for me anymore.  The problem is that I wouldn’t call myself a beginner but I far from even intermediate.

Thanks for voicing my internal struggle with this app. Not to mention the lessons are completely vanilla now.  Once you reach the end of the tree they never evolve.  Nothing compared to how complex and elaborate they once were.  No single app will ever be enough since true fluency requires lots of reading, watching, listening, talking with natives, etc, but at least Duo provided a genuine daily challenge at one point.  On top of that there's no way to brush up on specific subjects. It used to be where you could find exactly what you wanted to work on. Want to learn cooking? Verbs of motion? Dative Case?  Well maybe it's buried in there somewhere but good luck finding it . The firing of volunteers explains a lot.  They figured it only takes a small amount of content and some stupid animations to gamify it enough to keep the dumb masses hooked. It's pretty much a children's app at this point."

Firing the volunteer teams would be fine… if the company was going to put any effort into any of the courses that aren’t one of the big 4-5. They aren’t. It’s clear they’re not. But they won’t get rid of the courses because the variety of courses is one of their main selling points as an app. So all the other languages will just keep getting neglected, until they’re basically unusable. "

They couldn't have programmed it to test you on everything up to that point? Why is word review scored so low there's no way you can stay in a league doing it? Why isn't the alphabet and writing scored higher until you've reached mastery in it? Why is the horse \*\*\*\* awkward grammar translation I've been reporting every time I see it for 1.5 years still the one and only ""correct answer""?

My personal issue with Duolingo was when I started learning Mandarin and I discovered you can’t rep the Chinese flag in the leaderboard to show off which language you are learning. It literally shows up as a empty, white box.

I’ve tested it out. Duolingo will allow me to change it to any flag, including the Russian flag, but censors the Chinese flag consistently.

It’s such a small thing, but I lost a lot of respect for them as a company when I googled it and discovered it’s happening to others as well. Censorship and education don’t bode well together, in my opinion.

I used to be able to respond to the program by voice instead of typing which forced me to use correct pronunciation but since the AI started speech to text doesn’t work well. After dictating I have to read my response and correct spelling.  If the AI were really intelligent it would predict the words in a sentence from context just as IRL.

These avatars annoy me. I literally dont care, and the competition for trophies are kinda cool but honestly I just dont care.

That grammar notes are gone is awful but right now I don't care because I am already familiar with the grammar. (after all, I still had them on my first run)  
Same for community comments, which helped me a lot the first time.  
But what really gets me close to quitting is the hearts system. Just yesterday I failed to complete a new lesson with the five hearts I have available. It doesn't happen often, but it does. I lost one try because of a mistype, two others because I misheared the audio (the AI voice sometimes cuts off the beginning and there are homophones to begin with) and two more simply because it was leaning heavy on typing.  
Now I am scared to try again. Because I am afraid I would mess up that lesson again. I sometimes stop when I have two hearts left so they can refill to 5 and my chances are better.  
You realize none of the motivations I am given have to do with actual learning?  
In fact, they kept me from learning for almost two days.

Basically I get the complaints about the heart system the leaderboards and the comments but my main reason is that I found out that using Duolingo, while fun, made me in no way able to learn a language! At some point I needed the other paid apps to actually scratch that itch of being able to actually master a language.

But I admit that Duolingo is the best for starting out new languages. I don't want to pay an expensive Babbel or Lingvist or god forget the name of so many apps if I want to learn norvegian or Urdu for my oncoming trip. But still going back to that heart pressure is a ick in my mind, so I prefer just doing nothing.

PS: I was a heavy consumer of Memrise too, got using the app for 10 years thanks to the wonderful community content, much much much more useful that whatever Duo or Rosetta can provide. And just like Duo, Memrise put profits before users and cut off all their user related contents, leaving the app in a bland boring state. Deleted the app and didn't go back, and now im again learning a language through YouTube and dictionaries. Yuck!"

On one hand, most learning scientists will tell you that gamification is an *excellent* way of learning.

Second of all, nobody forces you to use the leagues. It literally doesn't change absolutely anything about your learning path if you choose to participate or not.

And finally, Duolingo is a complement, not a replacement for studying a language. You're not supposed to try and learn just using the app. It'd be too slow.

The idea is you dedicate a very short daily lesson *while* you study the language with more formal/traditional methods, that way Duo will assist you in expanding your vocabulary and with practice. But you're not supposed to depend on it exclusively.

With all due respect, I think you're complaining too much about quite irrelevant things (the visual aspect, that it's too gamified -even though that's the whole point of the app-, the leagues, the ads, etc) instead of focusing on the fact that it's a quite decent tool to expand your knowledge of a language in very accesible bit sized lessons."

Just provide you a base of knowledge that you can use to build off of. It sounds to me like you want it to teach you the whole language. Honestly I would never start a Duolingo course without knowing someone who can speak the language, without having some way to talk to someone who can. Personally I think speaking the language with someone outside of learning time is very important to actually learning the language. Duolingo simply can't give you that and as far as I've heard it doesn't have advanced enough courses to teach you how to be fluent in any language. It's more like a support app. I kind of agree with the taking away of the tool tips I guess if that's even true, it seems like a lot of the stuff you said wasn't even true. I hope you find a way to learn. Good luck on your journey away from Duolingo!"

My friend has been learning Ukranian with duolingo fir a couple of years and is pretty good at it now. She uses no other resource. I started with Duolongo for a few days, but found I couldn't understand it. So I got some structured learning material and started learning from tge beginning. Within a few days of that, I was able to make sense of the duolingo course , and I love the constant practise it gives ne with vocabulary and grammar rules that I am studying alongside it - this helps me practise what I'm learning. I'm now on level 18 if section 2. It is progressing at the perfect rate for me. I love it. I don't get hung up about leagues or friend quests - they're just there. They're nit my motivation for learning. They don't bother me one way or another. My friend had the free course and complained about the adverts slowing her down. The subscription was a reasonable price for something I really wanted to do, so I bought it straight away. I don't lose hearts and I get plenty of practise. I'm really progressing. The more I study, the more I notice and learn, and the easier it is to correctly form sentences. It is helping me get the most out of the other courses I'm studying. Nothing is free in this world. It's good that they permit a free version, but people have to accept that this will have limits. I'm happy with Duolingo."

Now I have to pay MORE to actually learn the language (making mistakes without teaching the concepts isn't learning). And on top of that the accuracy isn't guaranteed because it's AI! With community members you could gauge how reliable someone was, especially if you saw the same username appear frequently. Or you could only pay attention to comments that linked to a source. With AI, I don't know if I can trust it and I don't have any validation measures to determine my trust by.

also in terms of youtube channels for portuguese specifically, I’m gonna recommend you Speaking Brazilian Language School and Easy Portuguese (they do things like street interviews). also, if you want a show to watch I really enjoyed the Circle Brazil! reality shows are the best for hearing how people actually talk and to catch different accents"

The old DL was useful and some components are... but the reality is that the heart of language learning is being comfortable in making mistakes. The reintroduction of the heart system and gamification incentivizes engagement with points as opposed to a comfort with making mistakes... things like long form stories or other sorts of things where you can have a form to discuss with others as to why you made a mistake or also critical to learning.. but detrimental to profit.

In some cases, the two can co-exist if the proprietary is limited and deferential to the non-profit. However, in DL's case, their original non-profit mission was overridden by a proprietary model that puts profit and shareholders over an experience conducive to learning.

but some people don’t like it, and i can completely understand why. yeah, the subscriptions are expensive, but duolingo is also having to compete with others like babbel and rosetta. so, it’s going to be expensive, because they’re a smaller company using volunteers to help fund their business. they’re a very good language learning platform for those who are wanting to learn the basics and take that step to becoming fluent. because i said in my parent comment that no language learning app will make you fluent. you have to have someone fluent to help you. 

i know why i got downvoted, and i don’t much mind! people have their own opinions, and that’s okay! but i just don’t like when people say their opinions that are merely based on their materialistic wants and needs. and even then, some of those needs and wants are valid. if i could have ANYTHING changed with duolingo, it would be the pricing. i love their sales that they do for certain holidays and for schooling, but my schools do not use duolingo, or they don’t particularly enjoy it. i want the lower prices as much as the next person. i am just now starting to be able to afford it. and i would encourage people to save money for it if they’re as passionate about language learning as i and others are. 

but yeah, im getting downvoted because i was rude. that’s fine. i’m glad others agree with me, but i knew commenting my parent comment that some people would not enjoy my response."

What are your actual thoughts about Duolingo?,Misharomanova,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dua8lp/what_are_your_actual_thoughts_about_duolingo/,YoungBlade1,"To me, the best thing about Duolingo is that it helps me to keep a degree of consistency. I stopped using it for a while back in 2021, and was surprised to find that my French skills actually started to decrease noticeably. The reason is that once Duolingo was gone, my consistency was destroyed from a psychological perspective.



As long as I do at least one lesson a day, I can tell myself that I'm actively studying French. It is then an expectation for me to read a French book or listen to a French podcast or watch a French show, because I'm studying French, so of course I would do those things.


When I have no consistency, it's easy for me to not do those things. It no longer feels like I'm just going to study like I always do, but rather that I'm going to start studying again.


Perhaps it's because I have GAD, but starting something over again is a big mental hurdle for me, because it comes with all sorts of baggage and questions about if I'll manage to keep it up or if I'll fail to be consistent again.


I don't expect Duolingo to make me fluent in 5 minutes a day. I do know, however, that for me, that 5 minutes a day is important if I want to become fluent through more effective means."

I go through several lessons a day and I actually look forward to them, because I enjoy the app.

It’s an okay supplement to other resources (especially if you’re using the paid version, so that you have unlimited hearts), but won’t make you fluent on its own. I’ve been using it for a little over a month. While I know way more vocabulary than I did a month ago, I can barely construct sentences. I find that I can easily grasp beginner written material though, but I’d have to use more resources to reach the level of fluency that I want."

Ok so it's a bit more complicated than that; if you put me in a competitive environment I can be extremely competitive but I don't like it. And therefore I usually try to avoid anything which might put me in such an environment. 

I quite liked Duolingo in the earlier days, but when it started being very gamey and talking about streaks, I deliberately let it go because I didn't want that feeling. 

Other than that I think it was quite an effective learning tool."
What are your actual thoughts about Duolingo?,Misharomanova,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dua8lp/what_are_your_actual_thoughts_about_duolingo/,SpanishLearnerUSA,"Your decade comment isn't really relevant because it would take 10+ years to get to fluency using ANY method if all you did was a few minutes per day. 

My views are  simple....
1. It takes over 1,000 hours to feel mildly comfortable freely conversing in a language and consuming native media. 

2. Most people declare that Duolingo stinks after using it 5 minutes a day for a month...which is about 2 hours into that 1000+ hour journey. Even those people who did a lesson a day for a year have only done about 30 cumulative hours of learning. 

3. If using it, it should be one tool in your learning plan. While it is a solid way to practice grammar, it isn't good at teaching or explaining it. If you consume content in your target language and practice speaking with other people, you will learn the language....if you put 1,000+ hours of effort into it. 

It seems like Duolingo attracts all of the people with unbelievably unrealistic expectations. And the people who are at peace with the amount of effort it takes to learn a language rip on Duolingo (and its users) because they don't want to be associated with the group who thinks they'll be fluent in a month."

She knew a ton of vocabulary, could figure out what most written texts said, and could fumble her way to expressing most random sentences you'd ask her to say. I mention ""random sentences"" because she couldn't string them together into a conversation. Basically, she got really good at doing what Duolingo had her practice. 

With that said, I blame her. If she spent time watching Spanish TV, and if she practiced her conversational skills with actual people, she would have been fine. There are HUNDREDS of additional hours of work outside of the app that are needed for basic proficiency in the language."

2. You only need 5 minutes a day to be fluent.

Anyone who is at least mildly serious about language learning knows that these expectations are complete nonesense. But that doesn't mean that Duolingo is bad! It is a TOOL to complement a long and hard process that is language learning. It is there to show you the ropes of your target language and - in case of the well-developed French, Spanish and German courses - to give you a route to follow to build up your skills.

Here is how it should be used in my opinion as a 3rd year university student in language teacher training:

1. Start a unit in Duolingo, and get familiarized with the vocabulary and grammar concepts of that unit by doing the exercises.

2. Research the topics outside the scope of the app using other sources (YouTube, Google, textbooks, private teachers, native speakers etc.). That means that if you learnt about the basics of 'Präteritum' in German, then look up some more thorough guides on the topic. Or if Duolingo taught you family members like 'Mutter, Vater, Bruder, Schwester', why don't you check out how people say other relatives to extend your vocabulary?

3. Clean up the Duolingo unit - legendaries are the best exercises to test your knowledge - and move onto the next one.

With this method, I feel like I'm making very good progress in both the languages I'm learning with Duo, namely French and Russian. It does require a lot of work, obviouly, but there is NO magical language learning method that doesn't.

To sum up, Duolingo is indeed a very useful tool to use, provided that you know how to use it. If you fall for the marketing that says ""become fluent with just 5 minutes a day""...well, you are just stupid, quite frankly. To be fluent is a process that can encompass years and is not achievable with one source only, or without active immersion through media or native speakers."

With this in mind, I am going to make some comments for the Spanish from English course that I have completed:

1. It is very good at building a habit. Conversely, the leagues and mini games are useless, and should be turned off. Same for quests and xp, which unfortunately you're stuck with.

2. I learned a lot, but I supplemented with many other resources, particularly ones explaining grammar and building listening comprehension.

3. The bubble-clicking is useless and teaches nothing. The only way I found value in it was by using a Chrome extension which removes the bubbles and allows typing. 

4. They claim that there is spaced repetition built in, but it doesn't work. There are words I have forgotten because they appeared for a unit and were never seen again. On the other hand, I am glad I never had to see the words for Republicans and Democrats ever again. Internal US politics are of no importance to me. 

5. 15 min a day will teach you a language is a marketing slogan and not a reality. If you do one lesson a day you're lying to yourself. 

6. The recently added ""review grammar topic"" lesson when doing a practice node has potential, but it's badly done: When I am two years in, and on section 7, I don't need to review adjective agreement - it comes naturally with other sentences I have to construct. Giving me ""La niña es cubana"" when I have just dealt with imperfect subjunctive or future perfect is absurd. 

7. The stories should get harder and longer. Using the same format as right in the beginning is not building up difficulty, and therefore more and more useless the further you get. But they are funny and break up the monotony, which is a good thing.

8. The range of vocabulary is good and covers a wide array of topics that you can use to build up on. 

In short, there is value to be found in their flagship course, but be aware of the shortcomings and use it accordingly."

beyond that though, it's far from my main learning method (italki) in terms of efficacy. once you get past A2 you start noticing errors, ways they construct things that aren't at all like the spoken language, and realize that the order in which you learn a language is so far removed from how you'd actually speak it's borderline pointless beyond A2

anytime I'm advising people about language learning I always say just use it for introductory vocab and the moment you can introduce yourself at a very basic level (e.g. I am Bob, I'm from New York, I am in school, I also speak English and Papiamento), book a live lesson with a tutor, start watching videos w/subtitles in the TL, start reading, etc.

I'm not competitive and don't like the game-y aspects of it though, feels like it can lead to cheap dopamine hits rather than actual progression in a language. looking at some of the top XP people of all time in duo, I highly doubt they actually know a ton of languages, but instead are just getting points on the same language"

The app was always terrible, but I used it on the computer for years, that was where the value was. Now, the platform version is as useless as the app. It was never perfect, far from it, but everything that it did well has been removed.

1. Typing, actually typing letter by letter, was fantastic for learning the spelling. *No, that's gone, just build your answer from a predefined list of words.*
2. Having wiktionary open in another tab for ambiguous words. Other tabs in general, really. *More true than ever, in fact, open a new tab, and close Duolingo, as reading a dictionary is more useful now.*
3. So much info was available in the comments, links to blogs and articles that explain exactly what is troubling you. *This was honestly the best feature, but no, if people aren't mindlessly clicking and competing in useless leaderboards, they might actually learn. Perish the thought!*
4. The tips & notes section had amazing explanations without overloading you (for the most part). Eg. ""X is used in situations A, B, and C. There's also situation D... but we'll talk about that in a later skill"". *They were written by the people who designed the courses, so most of the time, you weren't getting a grammar overload.*

It wasn't perfect. It had its flaws. But it worked. I spoke to people in other languages, in their languages. I had entire conversations without using English. That was 90% DL. It taught me enough of how a language works, that a dictionary was the only **essential** tool moving forward. And all that was free! For years, it was free. When voluntary subscriptions came out, I happily signed up. I got so much for so long without costing me a cent. I was happy to give back, given all I had received. 

It genuinely pains me to see it reduced to such a useless state. It's a joke, and now it deserves all the hate people give it. It was never enough to become fluent, no app could do that. But it was enough to give you the tools to converse in your target language(s). No more."

Duolingo has helped me personally with learning Spanish up to a decent level, even though I also used a textbook and other resources. Getting to B1 on Duolingo will probably take even more than a decade though...

The thing is: I understand why Duolingo does things the way they do. It's hard to keep people motivated to come back and coming back is what makes you actually learn the language. Duolingo really pulls all the tricks you can imagine to achieve this goal and they do it incredibly well. Much better than we do. The only problem is that the rate at which you learn new things is suffering from all of this. Years ago I feel it was better, because you had more autonomy in what you wanted to learn. Ever since they introduced the ""new path"" I've grown to dislike it more and more. But then again, they seem to be more popular than ever, so they must be doing something right.

But I definitely have to give them their credit for helping me learn Spanish initially. Whenever I was traveling through Mexico, Guatemala or Honduras, I would just sit in the bus and practice my Spanish with the offline lessons. That was actually pretty great.

When you learn math you learn numbers and then addition, and then multiplication, then algebra, calculus and so forth. But if you instead remove those math classes and just do your times tables every day, do you think you'll ever be good at calculus in 5,10,20 years?

Duolingo is a tool like any other. It will help you build a habit and learn the basics. But once you've done that, you should immediately move on to things that are intellectually stimulating. Shuffling blocks around is only going to get you really good at shuffling blocks. 

And as an aside, a Duolingo user will always be proud of their streak. But to me, a streak is just a way to recontextualize  how ineffective the learning method of the app is. There isn't an infinite amount of content in the app. There isn't an infinite amount of sentences and grammar. Once you finish the courses, you're just spinning your wheels, never actually moving on to the actual language.

 Some month ago I encountered Spanish-speaking people during a bus ride. They were very loud, likely not expecting that anybody in my country will understand them.

I use this app as a reminder to keep learning and practicing. I learn vocabulary and basic sentence/grammar by the game-like activities and I use that info to try to make similar sentences throughout the day. I am trying to NOT memorize the words and translations but to *think* in the TL. Having simple sentences like the ones Duo provides has helped me learn to picture/understand what is being said rather than translating and then understanding if that makes sense. 

Also, Duo has free podcasts on Spotify that are GREAT. They're very simple stories with simple vocabulary in the beginning but they are great to use. The podcast(s) tells a portion of the story in the TL and then continues the story in the NL without translating. It has helped me recognize sounds and words in a slightly slower but still normal speaking tone and rate. And because I am getting better at recognizing words and meanings in normal use/tone/speed, I can follow simple conversations in public. It was definitely an improvement over what I could do in the beginning."
What are your actual thoughts about Duolingo?,Misharomanova,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dua8lp/what_are_your_actual_thoughts_about_duolingo/,mejomonster,"I haven't used it in years, so no idea if the newer changes are good or bad. When I did use it, I felt like it just didn't honestly describe how much it would teach you (but many language learning apps have this flaw), and it sort of implied you'd learn at a normal pace at a few minutes a day. So that's how people used it, and then they'd spend years and wonder why they were still 'beginners.' The reality is that most duolingo courses covered 2000-3000 words (last time I looked with the exception of maybe Spanish and French). That is equivalent to maybe how many words are learned in beginner 1 and 2 classes in college (2 semesters), or 4 classes in a slower paced high school class (4 semesters). But a classroom would also make you practice speaking and writing and help you improve any mistakes, and make you practice reading and listening to more dense materials. 

I think if you go through duolingo as fast as classroom pacing would (1-2 years) or faster, and do things outside of duolingo to practice the 4 skills, then it works fine to learn the beginner level of a language and get close enough to intermediate to go on to intermediate study materials, or reading/watching the language and speaking with people to learn more. But that would look like 30 minutes or more of duolingo a day, to get through the app at that pace, along with 30 minutes to potentially hours of non-duolingo language study time per day such as watching shows, reading graded readers, practicing writing sentences, practicing shadowing audio. I think duolingo can technically get a person to that A2 or just close enough to B1 area to start B1 study materials and activities, it's just the learner will need to practice the 4 skills outside of the app. And the learner will take years, unless they go through the app knowing this material only takes 6 months to 2 years for people to study if they were using a textbook or classroom. 

A lot of people start duolingo thinking it's paced to learn as fast as other materials that teach beginner stuff - but it's paced slow, and encourages smaller study sessions, unless you purposely think about how much time you want it to take to cover the material. And people may start the app thinking they'll be fluent when they're done, only to realize they were not taught enough to be fluent in the course. This second point is a flaw in many language apps, many textbooks and self study books usually at least mention it's only beginner level material when you start. A lot of apps falsely label stuff 'advanced' that's really like... A2 type material for beginners. So it's not a duolingo exclusive problem. And personally... I just felt duolingo went way through slowly through teaching things when I used it. I used to use duolingo and anki at the same time, and in anki I'd be studying maybe 20 sentences in 5 minutes and felt like in duolingo I was only getting through 5 sentences in 5 minutes. So duolingo felt slower to learn new things than other options I had."

However, it is limited as it is repetitive and some of the words it teaches you are really niche words I’m never going to use (nice to know how to say “sparkling apple juice” (apfelschorle) in German I guess). It’s also easy to get carried away with maximizing XP and challenges rather than properly learning the language.

Other than that, I’ll sometimes dabble in other languages just to see what they’re like and if I am interested in learning them on Duolingo."

Your goal gradually shifts from becoming fluent and communicating effectively in the TL to getting high scores and keeping your streak up, which I find is just… sad. Also, the weird sentences DO NOT help if you’re in a crunch to learn survival phrases (e.g. you’re traveling or you live in an area where it truly is “speak [insert language here] or starve”).

I’m not sure if it’s just not for my learning style or what, but I find it far easier to learn languages when I’m learning words and phrases that are immediately applicable and useful. It seems like you have to use Duolingo for over a year to get to any helpful words and phrases. Sure, maybe it’s “fun” to learn how to say “my pig ate my breakfast”, but that phrase won’t help me navigate through the city, make friends, shop at the grocery store, or book a train ticket. I’ve used it for years and…. I keep using it because I enjoy the gamified aspect… but it feels like it intentionally buries useful phrases in later lessons to ensure you get “hooked”."

I also use it for Arabic which i just started learning. It works well for my primary goal of learning vocabulary and practicing reading the script, but I know I will have to use other services to learn its grammar.

Generally the huge pro of the app is how easy (and fun) it is to use, making it much easier to incorporate language learning in your everyday life. But as others have pointed out you are much better off using it as a compliment to other methods."

In January my father booked a flight to come see me in march. Also then he said he is starting Portuguese on duo lingo to see how fast he can learn in the 2 and a half months until his visit. He has the pro version and is very into learning languages on apps, is like his hobby.

When he visited me I was surprised to see that he could very much communicate with my Brazilian boyfriend and all he did was Duolingo lessons. I'm not saying he was fluent, but he understood what my bf was saying in a clear language and could in turn respond with some pause for thinking. He was also using different tenses and spoke with a basic but correct vocabulary. The biggest issue was the pronunciation but that would be normal since he picked up the language very recently.

Honestly, he reached a lever that took me a year to reach (although I wouldn't say I studied very structured, more like immersion). 

So what I learned is that contrary to my preconceived opinions about these apps, they work for very specific purposes, like getting a good base of the language on your own. The gamification feature of the app kept him going even though the most boring parts of learning a language, when you can't really use it yet. 

I don't think Duolingo is a solution for learning the language but it is a big boost when starting. For me, I now have a level of language that outgrew these kinds of apps, but maybe my language learning journey would have been faster, have I picked up the app in the beginning. I myself didn't have the patience because it's very repetitive, but for some it really works."

Since then, I have witnessed firsthand the degradation and enshittification they have undergone.

Simply put, Duolingo is no longer an educational app. It is a revenue generating app. They ceased to have education as a concern the moment they IPO'd and continue to move further from that ideal daily.

Every single decision since that point has had nothing but profit as the motivator. More and more focus has been applied towards how to get users to spend gems, watch ads, bring friends to the platform...and yet, very little is actually done to improve the content.

Oh wow, sorry, I almost forgot about the ""improvement"" that everybody loved and definitely asked for. AI!

Now instead of having useful forums and real people to explain grammar and vocabulary, you can experience GPT and all of its wonderful hallucinations.

The best part, my absolute favorite, is how I purchased Super with the intention or removing ads. Yet, I still get ads for Duolingo Max. Interesting.

So I wrote to support asking them to point me to ANY point in the ToS or the page describing the Super plan that differentiates between what they call ""first party"" and ""third party"" ads.

I was met with silence. Unsurprisingly. What a great way to treat a paying customer.

This company knowingly lies to its users and attempts to sweep any and all criticism under the rug. The app convinces you that you are learning rather than allowing you to make any meaningful progress. It is an epic fall from grace and it's honestly pathetic considering how great this platform could have been as a champion of free education had they not allowed their avarice to get in the way.

As a professional linguist and a lifetime lover of languages, I wholeheartedly believe at this point that the day Duolingo goes under is going to be a great day not only for language, but for education as a whole."

My only real gripe is that it’s way too translation exercise-heavy the sentences aren’t contextualized so I often find myself just firing off a bunch of random contextless sentences in a vacuum. On the other hand, that’s why it’s really only one tool at your disposal to help supplement your learning. I’ll just use italki or some other exchange app if I want contextualized conversation practice.

It makes learning the basics of a language accessible and fun for people all over the world, especially for people who have very little language learning experience and don’t know where to start. I appreciate it for what it is, and some courses are much better than others. But if you’re looking for a one size fits all approach to fluency, or approaching it as more than a jumping off point, you’ll be very disappointed."

You can switch off part of it in the game itself. Also, I suggest starting a classroom, it will make your free account almost the same as a paid one...

I think Duolingo is a great free way to learn a lot of vocabulary but it's not great to get you to develop an ear for a language. I supplement with YouTube videos for that. It's less an issue if the language is close to yours I think, like I'm learning Italian right now (I just started) and just off my native French and basic Spanish knowledge, I feel like I can already understand 5-10% of spoken Italian without any training whatsoever, so Duolingo will be fantastic for me to learn this language, I feel like I already hear all the sounds when people talk. 

However I did the entire tree for Swedish and I feel like I can only understand 10% of spoken Swedish. My own accent seemed decent, I spoke to a few Swedish people and they'd reply in Swedish and then I would only get a little of their reply so we would then rapidly switch to English. I consider that a win that they would understand me very well and not reply in English right away. You get the patterns of accents from Duolingo so it's good for speaking decently, but it's too easy to hear when it's just short sentences without any noise and always the same kinds of sentences, it doesn't reproduce real speech. Some languages also have a broader diversity of accents. I feel like if I lived in Sweden and got true immersion, Duolingo would have given me a very solid base from which to grow.

It also works better if you already know more than 1 language, it helps a lot when figuring patterns on your own.

There's also no reason to limit yourself to 1 lesson a day or anything like that, go at your own pace. I did the entire Swedish tree in 2 months, some days only doing a few minutes, other days doing 2-3 hours. 

There is no reason not to try different tools and see what works best for you."

These people are by far the biggest market for language learning products, and to make money, the companies have to continue making unrealistic promises to people who aren't serious about learning. 

You can't learn a language using only one method. You need to use different tools for different purposes. Duo is always a useful tool for your arsenal, but it's never good enough by itself. More importantly, the quality of Duo is extremely different from language to language, and you won't know the difference until you already know enough of the language to recognize it. The voice quality in particular is just absurdly bad in most languages, and you won't want to emulate the pronunciation. It's still useful if it keeps you studying every day, but you should definitely grab a dictionary, a textbook or grammar book, and maybe a Pimsleur course, on top of exposing yourself early on to real text and audio in the target language."

My background is a bachelor’s degree in Latin (Duo is fine for basic Latin but won’t get you reading Cicero at all). I learned Russian from a textbook as well which helped reading and grammar and was bad for vocabulary and speaking. I’ve been using Duo daily for more than a year and I am seeing effectiveness in French. I also use it for basics in a lot of languages and continued review in Russian as a tool. It’s honestly fine if it gets you to learn a bit, especially because many people struggle so much that they never stick with languages as an adult.

I highly recommend having other tools and use the language. Use is the best way to gain fluency.

The reality that many people outside the western world face is a catch 22: English will provide more mobility, but English classes are typically very expensive so how do they afford it? 

Through Duolingo, those who need to prove their English proficiency can also pay $60 for a language proficiency test that is accepted across the US (and I assume other countries, but I’m more familiar with US). Non-Duolingo English proficiency tests can cost hundreds of dollars and require test takers to go in person. 

So to sum it up, Duolingo may not be for everyone, but is a great tool when used correctly and has been largely successful in accomplishing its original purpose, which is to provide free education for all."

It’s good for drilling words in context. If combined with other methods (listening, watching vids, some grammar lookups, flashcards, etc…) then it helps. Personally, I find it helps me with making ‘connections’ or patterns in the language. 

Like, I’ll see a certain phrase or word order often enough where I’ll start to intuitively understand why it is the way it is. Or if I don’t quite understand it, I can easily lookup somewhere else to make sense of it. I usually have an AI app open and occasionally I’ll post a phrase or sentence I see in Duolingo and have it explain. I’m already halfway there to understanding it because I’ve seen it so many times and the AI explaination will help me get the rest of the way there. I think that works better than just having the app explain outright because I have prior context. I’ve done it the other way and it didn’t really click for me for some things because I just wasn’t familiar with the usage at all. But having drilled it beforehand makes it more natural if that makes sense.

Anyways, Duo helps but I wouldn’t only rely on just it. Use multiple tools if you can."

What are your actual thoughts about Duolingo?,Misharomanova,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dua8lp/what_are_your_actual_thoughts_about_duolingo/,meganbloomfield,"It's okay as a supplement, but I feel like using it as a primary learning source just isn't worth the time. Any language learning regimen will have a variety of resources you use, but I feel that 4 hours a day spent on Duolingo will not reproduce the same efficient results that 4 hours of other kinds of studying will. It's a fun gamified app, which can be good for initial investment, but I just don't think it's worth relying on past the very very basics."
What are your actual thoughts about Duolingo?,Misharomanova,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dua8lp/what_are_your_actual_thoughts_about_duolingo/,HuecoTanks,"I really enjoy using it. I've been using it off and on since 2013, and just hit a four year streak today. I think it's a great tool for a lot of people, but definitely not going to make everyone fluent. I definitely view it as a supplement, and not a comprehensive language course.

Although, as an experiment, I did use it exclusively for three months before visiting Portugal. I am pretty solid at Spanish, but I had never studied any Portuguese. After the three months, I was able to order food and get directions while we were there. Admittedly, the similarities with Spanish probably helped a lot.

Some of my favorite things about Duolingo:
- It motivates me to be consistent, where before I would binge study for hours one day, then not study for a week, and wonder my my progress was slow.
- I like the reading/writing/speaking/listening, and variants of each. I have studied languages with both Pimsleur CDs and Rosetta Stone over the years, and while both of those were effective for me, their repetitiveness (at least 20 years ago) did slow me down sometimes.
- They regularly add/update content.
- Stroke order for characters (like hanzi for Mandarin) is SUPER useful!
- Targeted sound practice has really helped me differentiate between sounds without annoying native speakers.

Drawbacks:
- Sometimes the answers are just wrong, though I'm seeing that less and less.
- Some of the weirder sentences get repeated a bit much. In Vietnamese, I had,"" The goat is by the ferris wheel,"" and, ""She is that bee,"" dozens of times before learning how to say left or right. I get that some of this is probably to have examples of sounds, or other pedagogical reasons that are not clear to me."

What are your actual thoughts about Duolingo?,Misharomanova,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dua8lp/what_are_your_actual_thoughts_about_duolingo/,Potato_Donkey_1,"I think that Duolingo is pedagogically sound and that if you put in similar hours of effort, one method generally produces about as much progress as another effort.

I appreciate different learning methods in part because any method can be monotonous after a while.

I have learned a lot from Duolingo, more than skeptics seem to think I ""should"" have learned from it. In many cases, people have weird attitudes about learning. If a learner is having fun with a method, so skeptics think the method must be frivolous. In fact, a method that a learner finds enjoyable is far more likely to end up teaching the material because the user will stick with it.

I think it's fine to use any method, and often it's best to mix several methods. I also think that many language learners are strangely arrogant about what they have learned or the methods they used to learn it. Seems weird, but big ego can also generate big motivation to learn, so maybe arrogance isn't all bad."

But it's awful for teaching grammar, for teaching context of words, formalities, etc. Therefore, my opinion is that if you are learning a language, get a teacher or follow a specific course and use Duolingo only as an enhancement to the learning process.

No, you will not become anything near fluent only with Duolingo.

No, you will not become fluent with ""5 minutes a day"". It's already arguable the amount of time required if you dedicate 1 hour per day, how can somebody think that learning some random words without any context by 5 minutes per day will be the path to fluency? Ridiculous"

What are your actual thoughts about Duolingo?,Misharomanova,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dua8lp/what_are_your_actual_thoughts_about_duolingo/,dcporlando,"I find it to be a very strong course for someone wanting to learn Spanish.  As someone who has has tried every major app (Rosetta, Babbel, Busuu, Mango, Fluenz, Anki, LingQ, and more), classes, textbooks, and CI including Dreaming Spanish, I can say that it has been the most helpful of anything and by a wide margin.  

There are the detractors that make statements like you see in this thread that are really just false.   I don’t know if most of them have even tried it.  It is not a game but rather a gamified application through the addition of xp and leaderboards.  If that made it a game than getting a gold star in school made all of school a game.  The closest that they have to a game is match madness which is optional.  

It is not vocabulary only.  It teaches grammar, especially tenses, conjugation, word order, direct vs indirect, reflexive, etc.  Like with the CI method it focuses on exposure to the material more than grammar explanations.  At the same time, it has a pretty big vocabulary over a wide range of topics.  Back when I was in section 6, I got my anniversary report and I had 7,000 words in DuoLingo.  I am in section 8 now and I would guess I am closer to 8,000 words.  Most lessons seem to some some new vocabulary.   

There are plenty of flashcard systems.  DuoLingo is not one although it has some aspects.  It is not a phrase book that teaches you set phrases to memorize.  It is not a grammar book with 80% explanation in English and 20% drill with limited ability to check your work or listen and speak.  

Selecting words instead of typing is common for many apps.  It doesn’t negatively impact your learning although it does help you to remember words and assist you with getting the sentence correct, which is the goal.  Exposure to correct sentences and building correct sentences is what helps you learn.  Additionally, every time I do an exercise, I get at least a few typing questions.  

Multiple studies have found that adults do not stick with language learning unless they are forced to.   The number one predictor of success in learning a language is total hours spent consistently.   DuoLingo, by it’s design has increased that for users.  Secondly, you have to learn vocabulary and grammar while doing, reading, writing, speaking, and listening and DuoLingo does that more than others.  It also has far more content than most while going through a whole course.  

It doesn’t claim like some others that it is everything you need.  It claims that if you do some everyday, you will learn.   And you will.  And guess what, no matter how you want to learn, if you don’t consistently spend a lot of time, you won’t learn a language.  

Should you do more than DuoLingo?   Absolutely.   Read, listen, write, speak, use a grammar book that explains stuff more, join a class or get a tutor.  Those are all recommended by those who actually use it.   

Have people used it to learn successfully?   Absolutely.  And taken exams that prove their level.  Also, knowing many professionals that graduated DLI, DuoLingo is something that they recommended to me and something they use when prepping for their yearly test."

Makes it all ready stick in my brain.

Different strokes from different folks, some seem incapable of figuring out the grammar patterns. I think what language(s) you already know can help a lot since in the end the vast majority of languages are so alike. Those who only speak English seem to have the most issues with grammar given how simple English grammar is, i.e. the lack of gender, of declensions, the minimal verb conjugations, the lack of adjective conjugations, etc. Being fluent in at least 2 languages is a huge help, for instance just a simple concept is how in English you miss someone when they're gone for too long, but in French, someone misses to you (quelqu'un te manque). Or how some languages have a simple verb to express a concept that in another language, you need workarounds. 

Using Duolingo for 5 minutes a day doesn't make any sense to me, not sure why anyone would insist on doing that. Repetition works best when it's not *too* spaced."

A grader reader is one of the ways you learned your native language.  You followed a story where you saw a word used multiple times in the context of a story that makes sense to you.  People think things like DuoLingo work better because they offer badges and checkpoints and other things that make you feel like you're achieving things.  

Listening to podcasts and reading graded readers won't have you walking away saying ""I learned the future tense today!"" but... after a couple months you'll have a comfort with the language that years of Duolingo doesn't bring.  But it's easier to say ""I learned x number of words,"" than, ""I'm familiar with conversational markers and speech patterns and the various contexts in which speakers use \_verb\_.""  So the \*sense\* of accomplishment has people coming back.

I can't be less enthusiastic about Duolingo -- I used it regularly for 5 years, took an entrance exam in a language school, and was placed into....... A1.  Because I truly couldn't speak!

After 3 weeks in the school I was able to introduce myself, ask common questions, tell about my day, discuss things I need / want to do, etc., things I was lacking after 5+ years.  Sure, DL gave me vocabulary and a familiarity with vocabulary and sentences... but everything was so lacking in context and outside of conversation that I felt like I was piecing together bits from some ancient civilization, not participating in a modern language.

Duolingo is... fine, for a couple inefficent uses.  Like I said, couldn't be less enthusiastic."

It's a great party trick, but overall not more useful than a deeper knowledge of a language.

If you like Duo old design -> try **Listlang**  
If you are alright with ugly and simplistic design -> try **Anki**

Then, come back and see if you still think Duo is good for vocabulary.

I’m not being mean, but to be able to consume native media, you need around the top **3,000** most frequently used words. With Duo’s pace, if you use it as your main source of vocabulary acquisition, it would require years (2 +) for a close language with thousands of hours to reach this threshold.

You can achieve this much quicker by using a better tool in a fraction of the time.

If someone is struggling in the intermediate level, between B1 and B2, or needs vocabulary for certifications and learning targets, **I would never suggest Duolingo** as the primary tool.  
As a supplement to fill up time, decompress, and build a routine, sure.

**word counts is just the mean to an end**, taking years to reach enough vocab to be able to watch an youtube video of a close language  is not acceptable, and definitely counts against  **this a good tool for learning vocab.**"

2.Duo counts variations of the same word to pump up those numbers. 

3.you  learn 10 words for an hour of study using Duo. You much ahead of the average. How many ppl drill things they already know just for xp?

4. It would require you more than 300 days 1h per day, being someone that is actually trying to complete the roadmap and conclude the course. The average user would take way longer than that, no wasted time in lessons to hack xp.


5. You might already notice this on russian against spanish, you will need to “hard learn more” words, since has less word that you could guess the meaning by knowing the stem. 

The target being be able to consume native content netflix/youtube you would see the most of the users even with hundreds of hours  can’t do that, the average user will take around 2y for doing this, varying if is a close language such as french or spanish.

Also, learning 5 new words per unit is amazing (it's much more at the beginning btw), when you consider that early units are a breeze, and you are much more likely to properly memorize them asap through actually applying these words in sentences and having to recall them immediately, compared to Anki's dictionary feel, even if you have example sentences there.

Anki starts beating Duolingo in vocab once you are closing in on intermediate level, because at that point you don't really want to practice sentences anymore, you just want to purely learn some vocab (+ some more complex grammar), so it's much more easier and convenient to cut straight to the chase. That's why Anki emerges as the superior vocab app **in the long run**, because Duolingo is a jack of all trades, but master of none. 

But it's entirely pointless to compare the two because it's the age-old apples vs. oranges debate. Duolingo is praised for its vocabulary, because for a jack of all trades app, it is really good at teaching vocab in a natural way. It would be just as unfair to trash Anki for being horrible at vocab, because it's much easier to just learn every single new word from context: it's true, but you almost need to be a C in order to be able to do that, so it's a completely moot point.

Also, you don't do your argument any favor with your ""300 new words"" hyperbole. Once you are at an intermediate level, you won't even learn 300 new words from Anki in a month, let alone in an hour. At best you'll see 300 new words, but first it will take a lot of repetition to familiarize yourself with them, and you still need to pass the test of actually recognizing them outside of Anki, and then finally being able to implement it in your own vocabulary, which is a long, long road."

reasons why you should / should not use Duolingo,Slumbers3242t64,https://i.redd.it/ve1nhf5ji9ee1.png,Mediocre-Sundom,">reasons why you should

If you want to learn the very basics of Japanese, Duolingo is a nice 'all in one' place that will get you to the point of being able to order food or ask for directions during your next trip to Japan. It might even make you able to hold a very simple conversation in Japanese. It will teach you Hiragana, Katakana, popular Kanji, most used words, simple sentence structure, and other basics - all in one nice-looking app.

If you, for some reason, don't want to put any effort into combining several different tools for your studies, like Anki, textbooks and video courses, and only want one app to do it all for you - Duolingo is probably the best one you can find.

>why you should not

Duolingo isn't as much of a learning tool as it is a free-to-play mobile game. While it will teach you some of the language, it will make it as inefficient and slow as possible. Duolingo isn't interested in you learning quickly and efficiently - that's contrary to the whole business case. They want you coming back and staying as long as possible. You can learn the same things a lot faster and in much better ways if you decide to put in a tiny bit of effort.

Duolingo's Japanese is extremely rigid, artificial and weird. Many sentences taught are near useless in real life. The pronunciation is often just wrong, because their text-to-speech engine doesn't always work correctly with the language where the pronunciation is so depended on the context. The AI tools are also pretty universally trash. 

They are also extremely predatory in their monetization, constantly interrupting your learning to upsell you stuff. They promise ""no ads"" learning with Super subscription, but the very moment you pay for it they will start serving you of the higher tier Max subscription and upselling its features. And if you decide to pay for Max, it's no longer a good value for your money, considering how much quicker you can learn the language for a fraction of this cost."

reasons why you should / should not use Duolingo,Slumbers3242t64,https://i.redd.it/ve1nhf5ji9ee1.png,vytah,"There are multiple reasons why Duolingo sucks:

* It's slow. It takes ages to finish a course. Before the path update (2022 I think), you could at least regulate the amount of reviews and new content at will, so you could finish Duolingo fast and then switch to actually using the language, even if your vocab wasn't perfectly drilled, now you can't. To quote some guy from Youtube: ""Duolingo doesn't want you to learn a language. Tinder doesn't want you to fall in love and get married.""

* It's even slower if you're a non-paying user, as the 3-mistake limit will kill any momentum.

* The review system they have is crap, it reviews things that are trivially easy instead of those that actually need to be reviewed.

* It prioritises pointless flair over language. I don't know if that's still the problem, but when I used it on my phone, when the sentence was too long so that the cartoon character, the source sentence, and the word bank didn't fit on the screen, instead of removing the cartoon character, Duolingo simply partially solved the sentence, and sometimes ""partially"" meant the part was 100%. So all I needed to tap was the continue button.

* Bad text-to-speech audio.

* No or very minimal and incomplete grammar explanations. This at least is fixable by reading up on grammar elsewhere, but without guidance it might be hard to know where to look.

* Bad explanations of mistakes.

And there are Japanese-specific problems:

* Indecisiveness about higarana and kanji usage.

* Americanisms, like explaining pronunciation with ""さ as in ‘sock’"", or using made-up words like ""sophomore"" for 二年生.

* Duolingoisms, like saying that 半 means ""thirty""

* Incorrect furigana.

* Incorrect pronunciation.

* Incorrect furigana together with different and also incorrect pronunciation.

* Issues with word segmentation. Sometimes they split the Japanese sentence so that they split word in the middle and glue one of the halves to another word. It becomes more of a jigsaw puzzle instead of a language learning tool.

* And the general textbook style of example sentences.

I think Duolingo is very mediocre when learning any of their ""big"" languages, but for other ones, like Japanese, it's out right bad. I'd recommend using it only if you cannot use anything else.

BTW, I finished the Duolingo Hungarian course. I cannot speak Hungarian at all. All I remember is bits of grammar I've read up somewhere else. Make of that what you will."

reasons why you should / should not use Duolingo,Slumbers3242t64,https://i.redd.it/ve1nhf5ji9ee1.png,Bluemoondragon07,"I think beginners should use Duolingo because:

1. Encourages them to keep their streak and consistently do a short lesson every day. Especially good for consistency when someone does not have a lot of free time to study every day.
2. The way Duolingo teaches hiragana and katakana is a quick and effective way to memorize it in my opinion.
3. It is fun and gamefied, further reinforcing interest in the language.
5. It's free and accessible. 
6. It has speaking exercises

But, beyond those things, I guess one shouldn't use it because:

1. If you take the English course for Japanese, it will prioritize teaching you the words and phrases that are easiest to understand from an English viewpoint over the most commonly used or accurate words. For example, prioritizing ボトル over 水筒 for the English  'water bottle'.
2. Maybe it depends on what route you choose when you start the Japanese course, but I think I chose ""for fun"" route when I started, and it took a loooong time to teach me plain verbs, informal language, and Kanji. I guess most textbooks do that too, though. 


I don't think Duolingo is that bad. I finished the whole course, and I'm glad it let me skip a lot of sections. It's free. It improved my skills a lot.

It gets especially difficult when a problem like the one shown comes up where you translate ENG to JPN first. If the sentence has multiple adjectives, you won’t be given any hint as to the hierarchy that they expect. The service improved a bit when they began copying Bussu but unfortunately they also copied Bussu’s forced linearity at the time, doing away with your ability to skip and go back to certain lessons so now you’ve got no agency in the app anymore."

* You want to learn basic Japanese in less than 2 years.
* You want actually to be taught new concepts with big boy words and then move on.

The way they teach the kanas made me rub my head first, months to just finish the kana practice when you could finish them in a week or two with proper study? Especially since they're so essential to then fast forward your studies instead of relying on romaji? Odd choice, I'll let it slide

But then they do ridiculous things like in their time section, where instead of saying ""2:30 ""ni ji han"" is ""half past two"", literally teaching you that ni is 2 and han is half, they teach you ""two thirty"" and literally tell you that han means 30😭😭😭

I already knew what han meant but this could throw several people off on what it means, it's just an allround lazy and bad way to teach a language, especially a language as foreign as Japanese to English. They take shortcuts to make it seem as similar as possible, making the game funner but the learning far worse.

Backtracking to my kana issue, it also is excruciatingly ill-paced, a issue I find with Duolingo in general.

Honestly, what grills me the most is just the attitude we collectively have for the app as some sort of ""THE orthodox and legitimate and maybe only way to learn a language"", which is odd

think of learning japanese as a unique journey that only you go through. duo can be that perfect tool that gets you to practice every day but what makes you learn is the books and a tutor. reddit community helps your mindset and your irl friends also cheer you on. time changes, duo is out but renshuu is in and you are on youtube listening to native speakers. then time changes again and the only thing you have time for is duo. duo might be the single thread keeping you studying until you get that job and then you start back on Satori reader.

original comment below:

:::::::

this. i turned off romaji day one and switched to typing answers (wherever available) instead of selecting them on day 2. it's actually been much better than i expected based on the comments i've read here and elsewhere. they even actually do (basic, i'm sure) grammar education. 

and i don't just trust it- i have been self-directing more kana drills and vocab review (using the kana and practice tabs, respectively) instead of just blindly following the lessons, and of course i'm supplementing with other resources. 

i'm sure it's not ideal for someone to use duolingo only long term. but i'm finding it to be very good as a ""core"" intro to the language while i'm learning basic sentence structure and kana at least, and maybe beyond."

* And then there are just texbooks. Genki is universally recommended, and I can attest to its usefulness - that's how I started learning.

I can also recommend ""Japanese From Zero"" YouTube videos to get you started. There are also books that YouTube videos follow, but for your purposes videos are probably just fine, and will supplement other tools above nicely. I don't know what the overall sentiment about George Trombley (the author of From Zero!) is in this community, but I quite like his personality and find his way of teaching pretty approachable.

People speaking slower will subconciously pronounce things in ways they would not in real conversations. I recently started watching Japanese shows and try to get used to the speed of the speech, for now I recognize enough words to theoretically get the gist of most sentences as long as I am familar with the material, but still cannot process it fast enough. But I got there in two other languages, and I don’t expect it to be different in Japanese with more time spent listening and sometimes pausing and rewinding.

For me, Duo fills a niche in being easy while still forcing me to actively engage with it by making me answer questions. With pure input like reading or listening, it is too easy to zone out when I am exhausted, and the benefit then is not bigger than Duo making me repeat conjugations I learned more than a year ago.

Then, the streak counter is a nice carrot. Of course it is utterly meaningless, and I deactivated most gamefied things in the app, but the counter works just well enough to ensure I don’t skip a day.

Tbf, Anki does most of the things, but I never liked learning new things via premade decks. I want to pick up a word somewhere, see it used in different contexts, get the Kanji down, and only then add it. My own deck now has about 1200 words in, and it worked well so far.

The lack of grammar explanations is ridiculous, but for me it’s way better for sentence-based exercises than most other platforms. At least until I’m ready for reading.

But most of the skipping was just skipping the reviews. With the new system, you only need to do the very first lesson in a ""section.""  after that first lesson, it just makes you review it a bunch more times, so it's more efficient to skip to the next section with the placement quiz right after that one lesson.

I'll quote my own post from a previous thread because it really irks me when people say ""there's no harm in doing a little bit of mindless duolingo every day"":

> Duolingo is like eating snow to stay hydrated in a snowstorm.. It sounds like a good idea because snow is literally water but the energy your body spends melting it eventually makes you less hydrated and it's actually more dangerous. You're better off not drinking at all.
>
>Duolingo makes you think you're learning Japanese and actually progressing by using psychological predatory tactics to keep you coming back for more and more but you're barely moving forward (and this is ignoring all mistakes which there are plenty).
>
>I've seen way too many people with literally years of daily streaks in Duolingo thinking they are learning Japanese with a level of knowledge that is honestly at the same level of someone who did a few weeks of genki. I'm 100% convinced that, at least for Japanese, Duolingo is a scam app.

If you are already studying Japanese doing **other stuff** that isn't Duolingo, then no need to waste time with Duolingo. If you aren't, and instead want to ""keep up with Japanese"" by doing a little bit of Duolingo every day... good job, you fell for their psychological trap and mindgames. It won't help you learn Japanese, but instead it will stop you from doing other things because ""I've already done a bit of Japanese today, I don't need other apps/tools/exercises, I can only afford 5 minutes anyway!"". 

Plus, I wish people stopped giving Duolingo so much exposure, clicks, downloads, and time spent in the app. It's a bad app, with sleazy practices. It needs to die out and give space for better apps and tools instead."

Duolingo, for Japanese, **does not work**. I hate to see beginners get scammed into this app over and over again and then be convinced that it helps. It does not help, no matter how much you think it does. They literally make you believe it works, but it doesn't. They employ psychologists and researchers into gamification practices (not expert linguists) to make sure people spend time in their app to convince them that their streaks work, but it doesn't. If you read any research papers done by Duolingo developers (and they write quite a bit) they are all about how to keep users engaged, how to feed them these nuggets of streaks and fake knowledge, just to keep them in the app. They started out as a language learning app, and then realized getting people stuck on the app brought them more money, and here we are. This is also why they spend so much money on social media outreach, meme (learn spanish or vanish, etc) and stuff like that. Because it sucks people into their predatory ecosystem. It's all done with purpose. 

> Im just saying for free app than you can bang out an exercise or two on while on the bus or train its fine.

There are many many many many other apps you can use on the bus for a quick burst of Japanese that aren't Duolingo and I recommend you use those. Renshuu, busuu, lingodeer, bunpro, anki, or even just read some manga or listen to some podcast or anything. Do **literally anything else** that isn't Duolingo, and you'll find it much more beneficial and you will actually learn Japanese.

> Duolingo is a tool. It's your responsibility to learn how to use it, when to use it, and what its limitations are. But if you want to rage at a hammer, I guess you can.

The point is that most people who use this ""tool"" (and especially those that recommend it) have no idea what they are doing and they are convinced it's going to help them achieve their goal (even if slowly). But evidence shows it simply doesn't work, so as a ""tool"" it's effectively useless. You may not have realized that, and maybe you never will, but trust someone who's spent almost a decade among Japanese learners and had this interaction with Duolingo users a thousand times. I have **never** seen someone use Duolingo and come out of it with a better understanding of (even basic) Japanese compared to any other option out there. Yet, for some reason, I have **never** had this issue with people using lingodeer, busuu, renshuu, anki, etc. Only Duolingo. Ask yourself why.

And this isn't even touching the myriad of actual literal mistakes that the app has, which are damning enough already."

I've wanted to start learning japanese for a few years now. But every time I got overwhelmed with where to start. The sheer number of resources put me off, and of course looking at Hiragana/Katakana and Kanji made it look impossible to my eyes.  
Adding to that, I have huge problems with discipline. I have a very hard time to stick to things.

But about 160 days ago I saw a friend using Duolingo to learn spanish and I thought it couldn't hurt to try that. The slow pace never made me feel overwhelmed and the options to have everything in romaji or later with furigana helped with not feeling overwhelmed with the Kana and Kanji.

To be clear, Duolingo didn't magically make me a good learner. I tracked my time, I am at about 130 hours (Duolingo and other sources), so not even 1 hour per day. But for me that is a huge achievement and I know for a fact that I could never have done this much if Duolingo didn't give me an easy entry point into the language.

At the moment, I don't mostly rely on Duolingo anymore. I learn Vocab through Anki and I'm working through the grammer with Cure Dolly. My time spend is probably about 50% Duolingo and 50% everything else.

  
With all that said, I still feel that the common criticisms of Duolingo are Valid. It is NOT an effective resource. Judging by my own progress with the different resources I can clearly tell how slow Duolingo is at teaching a language. I am very aware that I could have used my 130 hours more effectively.

I’ve tried books, YouTube, JFZ (even back when it was YesJapan), podcasts, Genki, Tae Kim, Anki, RTK—the works. I’ve always made a great start learning and then stalled out and failed to retain. 

Before my last trip to Japan, I bit the bullet and paid for Duolingo. The gamification aspect is absolutely not an optimal learning method, but I just passed a 450 day streak, which is by far more consistent Japanese learning than I’ve ever done in about two decades of half assed learning and relearning. It may not be the best way, but it’s motivating and fun, and you absolutely do learn. 

During the past 450 days, I’ve also started listening to Nigongo con Teppi, and I’ve incorporated Anki and Wanikani into my routine along with Duolingo. I won’t pretend that I’m anywhere near conversational, but the consistency and constant motivation have helped me to stay on track, and I feel like I’m learning a ton.

The way it used to be is that on PC you had infinite hearts even if you weren’t a premium member. They took that away. I can’t do very much without making 5 mistakes and once you make 5 mistakes you have to pay in game currency or you can’t continue learning. What a load of trash.

I understand why because learning a language is just such a time consuming activity that basically takes years and years before you even get to a ""basic"" level. I mean, it's a pretty hard sell, especially if you are an adult with responsibilities like work, bills, relationships, etc.)

Might be unpopular belief, but if you plan to be a citizen of that country, you should learn the language of that country. Learning a language opens up learning customs, culture, and more in order to adapt to the social ""rules"" and norms that people should follow as of form of general respect

That being said, though, I do think any kind of active exposure to the language. I haven't tried Duolingo, and it might not be perfect, but it's better doing something than nothing"

Even if Duolingo can't help you with like, full on learning, it is an excellent tool for what it is. 

The same is true for English, but since we speak it as our primarily language, we're constantly reinforcing our understanding of our own language, sometimes reinforcing incorrect things. I'm sure you've noticed that your English vocabulary similarly wanes and waxes depending on who you associate with, what field you work in, etc. That's because you still need a way to reinforce things you learn. 

Since you can't associate with Japanese people easily outside of Japan, that means tools like Duolingo become really valuable, since they can help you reinforce where you can't do it naturally."

But IMO it still isn't very good.  I don't hate it, but I think there are so much better options for what you could have done if you wanted to learn Japanese.

It might get you to spend 5-10 minutes a day studying when you otherwise wouldn't and that is a good thing... but those 5-10 minutes of studying are low quality and give low returns compared to other ways you could have studied with that time.  At best in that time you might be exposed to a couple new vocab words in context, but without any good spaced repetition you likely won't remember them long term.

The translations are really rigid, which isn't great for a language like Japanese that doesn't really translate 1:1 with English.  I think Duolingo is better for something like English to Spanish since they are much more similar languages without as many complications of Kanji, different sentence and grammar structures, etc.  The lessons you get in Japanese Duolingo for those topics are really thin, if they even exist at all.

Duolingo is good at making you ""feel good"" about doing some language studying but if you actually want to learn there are so much better options.  Getting hooked on Duolingo might help you do a tiny bit instead of nothing, but it might also get you learning a lot less than if you found another study system and spent the equivalent time on it.

It might have improved since I last used it.  When I first tried it years ago it was *awful*, clearly an afterthought to some of the other languages.  Last time I tried it they had improved it somewhat, and that was still probably at least two years ago.  But pretty recently they also laid off a huge number of their translation staff and are pivoting to AI based translation to write lessons which seems like a pretty big red flag to me that quality may drop."

Honestly if Duolingo had a more reliable way to do without the word bank (both typing and oral answer, which are atrocious atm) it would be infinitely better.

I started with duolingo and it's the perfect start. You learn the kana early one, you see the vocabulary in a lot of different sentences you slooooowly see new grammar concepts (even though the explanations lacks a lot, but at least you see a lot of common constructs). 

After a few units I started Genki 1 and was positively surprised that I could read the first few chapters and do most of the exercises already. I then added a genki deck to anki, so I can do genki alongside duolingo which works nicely. I learn vocabulary for a few days, until I finish the ones for the unit and then do the unit. rinse repeat. 

Now I joined the wanikani book clubs, they give vocabulary lists for the manga, I made myself an anki deck from that and added it. Learning vocabulary for a book, seeing them used just make them click and the learning is so much deeper.

Duolingo is something that advertises itself as an app designed to learn a language in 10 minutes a day. It doesn't advertise itself as a starting point to language learning. It doesn't advertise as a companion to learning along with other, more thorough products.

It is still making money off of people who want to learn a language but don't want to learn how, instead just want an owl to tell them that it's going to be ok as long as number goes up.

Any defense of Duolingo involves the heavy use of alternatives and things outside of Duolingo. It's simply a waste of time as long as other resources exist. And better resources have existed for a long long time. 

In your metaphor, the 30 day abs videos are exercise programs to get people in the habit of exercise. How many of those people actually get in the habit of exercise? How many people actually convert from couch potatoes to active people? 

For Duolingo to be successful gateway, it would need to have a proven history of people who now are somewhat proficient in Japanese after the Duolingo program and I just don't see how that making any sort of sense as after graduating Duolingo, you would barely be past the genki 1 or 2 level with extremely limited vocabulary and no output."

(Though honestly since it jumps straight into full kanji and kana use I tend to NOT suggest it to beginners)

The focus on sentences, and the method in which Duolingo progresses from simple to more and more complex really helped me nail down sentence patterns and pick up new vocabulary when things like Anki stopped producing results for me.

Duolingo certainly has its drawbacks, and some features do allow for learners to shoot themselves in the foot (I'm looking at the word bank) but switching to keyboard entry is a simple fix that stretches that output muscle.

The new path is slow, but having been on the old tree... and having focused more on gold gilding my tree ASAP than learning... then having to reset my tree and stagger redoing lessons... the path is the objectively better option for most users since it has the SRS built in.

At this point I read books and watch TV shows to learn, and if I learn anything it's just picking up loose vocabulary. My understanding is good, however my output is still pretty limited. So I occasionally return to Duolingo to work on getting some sentence patterns into active memory.

:) It's certainly not an all in one, or a stand alone program. And you certainly can't get fluent in just 10 mins a day. But I definitely feel it has more to offer than some people give it credit for."

After I completed Busuu, I jumped on Duolingo to use the rest of the annual subscription before it expired and ended up loving it. It’s a great reinforcement tool and targets areas I may be unsure of when speaking the sentence. I’m even doing the music course on there too to get back into playing piano again. 

Is Duolingo for absolute beginners? I still don’t think it is. I wouldn’t recommend a complete beginner to start unless they wanted to try it out. I recommend learning the grammar rules until the end of N4. Then go back and relearn through Duolingo. That’s what I did and it has helped me pick up more vocabulary than before. 

Genki I wasn’t too sure about when I first started learning Japanese. I felt very overwhelmed by it. I think if I was in a class that used it, then it would’ve been better. I use Genki now to go back over the rules and stuff."

This assumption is definitely not true--I never touched Anki once. It's not that hard to just learn vocabulary words from textbooks while you use them, and then from real-life books and other media once you lay the textbooks aside. Perhaps current-day language learners are more Anki-dependent than they were a decade or two ago (that certainly seems to be the case), but I don't see that as an argument for using Duolingo or any other app--the textbook --> real life train still works just as well now as it always has. To be clear, I have nothing against Duolingo or any app if they help people, but I feel like there's a bit of ""you either use Anki or you use apps"" thinking here, when really neither is necessary at all."

Or, really buckle down and study and you can learn a language in just 3 months!

> Compare that to the non-stop linear progression of using an app, where every single time you use the app you can see yourself closer to the finish line.

The problem is that it's a lie on both counts. Duolingo lies about quality and about progress.

It tells you you're making progress, it boasts being compliant with some programs and using Spaced Repetition, but...

... Duolingo lessons consist of repeating the same word/kanji ten times today and five tomorrow then never seeing them again. And even then - *the kanji has four roots, but what are they and how are they related to the word? Who cares, just memorize the stroke order, get the quest done and run on.*

You're successful every day, but you're only successful with a small amount of material. Anything from a week or a month ago gets lost and forgotten because it's not needed.

People get addicted to the flashy app, the constant cheering and the small dopamine rushes and then they have a hard time actually doing the work and learning the grammar because that's hard and nobody's cheering you on when you're trying to learn something practical and remember it a month later.

I've also seen it mark sentences wrong for using dictionary form rather than ます form. If you understand when it's wrong like that then it's okay, but for new learners it can do more harm than good.

I did poke into Duolingo a bit when I was starting to refresh on Japanese but I find Renshuu and Lingodeer much better for that. Renshuu has gamification if you want to use it that way, which I think is a key component of why so many people stick with Duolingo.

I am adding on top of that, the typical mountain of anime that I usually watch in Japanese dub, ENG subs; and questions & answers with [Pi.ai](http://Pi.ai) 

While I doubt that this will give me any level of proficency, it is actually helping me a lot to start. Hiragana was looking very daunting, and slowly Duolingo is exposing me to it. Without realizing, it seems I can already read 90% of hiragana. Even I recognize some kanjis, associating them to some words... I didn't want to learn Kanji, yet I am somehow learning it.

It is helping me to add a bit each day. I was very motivated at the beginning but quickly lost the motivation to take it seriously, so my pace has slowed down a lot. Duolingo forces me to put at least 5 minutes each day.

The exercises look very repetitive and super simplistic specially at the beginning - but once I got the hang of it I decided to skip to more advanced sections by ""cheating"" - running the exam with dictionary, lots of patience, and asking questions to [pi.ai](http://pi.ai) ; that led me to courses that I really find difficult, and stuff that I missed. But slowly I got back my footing by seeing more examples and asking questions to the AI.

In Duolingo you learn basically by repetition and sheer exposure to the language. I thought that it didn't work, until one day I was watching anime and I realized that I was understanding more words that I never understood before.

I haven't spent a single euro in Duolingo. Haven't bought anything. I thought the limitations of the free plan was the hearts, but turns out that you can refill them with more practice. Which is not bad.

At the moment, If you want to learn Kanji from a section, you will be presented with the same 4 or 5 Kanji over and over again until the progress bar is high enough. Then it will only show you the next 4 or 5 Kanji over and over again. And you have to do every single Kanji a lot of times for the progress bar to fill up. So typically I would have to do a group of Kanji for 15 minutes until the next group gets shown to me. And then I never see those first few Kanji again.

That system doesn't work at all for me. I don't learn a Kanji if I'm repeatedly shown it for 15 minutes and then never again. It gets into my short term memory and a few days later I have forgotten it.

For me personally the Kanji section would have to switch to an SRS system. Currently I don't use it at all because I have already put in 2 or 3 hours without having learned anything."

The way the brain works, any input at all helps you retain things. That is true for basically every skill you can think of.

If you don't learn, you forget stuff (obviously), and even 5 minutes of revising what you did yesterday + learning 1 more thing makes you learn 1 thing per day.

Obviously learning will be slow that way. Even completing a Duolingo course would take many years or decades depending on the course length. And after completing a Duolingo course you are nowhere near proficient at the language.

But still, the most important thing in learning is to do something every day, even if it's just 5 minutes. And Duolingo very much encourages people to learn more.

But it’s also given me a bit of a framework of grammar I can work with by quickly googling new words to add to the pre-existing sentences. 
It definitely has its place brute forcing the basics."
I changed my mind about Duolingo,lee_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1b76qqc/i_changed_my_mind_about_duolingo/,lee_ai,AI voices are still quite unnatural in English from what I've heard so far. It's still sort of in the uncanny valley where it sort of sounds human but not quite. I'm guessing Japanese will trail behind a bit since most of the cutting edge AI stuff I've seen is very English-biased. Satori reader is a good sort of beginner/intermediate tool where they get native speakers to dictate their short stories

I gave it a try for a 38 days streak: I learned roughly 1000 words and reached the Emerald league. I stopped using Duolingo because the sentences and translations were getting too weird on the level I was playing. The UI on the phone was frustrating at times as some of the words were hard to press (you sometimes had to press just outside the word to select it). Some kanji also consistently had the wrong furigana (shichi on the audio and nana on the furigana).

The most annoying part with free vs paid is that paying users also get unlimited gems so they can gild all the lessons as they go (so an extra 120 XP per lesson with XP boost), instead of having a gilding limit per day. This got annoying in the emerald league as all the promotion spots were taken by paying players clocking >5k XP/day.

WaniKani is essentially sort of a wrapper around an Anki deck btw, I believe you can download the Anki deck online for free and just use that instead if you prefer. You lose a bit of the gamification but at its core thats what WaniKani is. They'll give you reviews at intervals, you rep them, etc."

Eventually you'll want to read Japanese outside of Duo and there won't be English to help you.  It's like watching anime with English subtitles...you're not reading Japanese or really even listening to Japanese, you're just reading English.  Not saying I watch anime in Japanese without subtitles, that's far beyond my current skill level.  But I also don't delude myself into thinking I'm learning Japanese in the process, it's just entertainment.

What really helped me with the kana was doing the character practice lessons and writing them down as I did them.  I wrote each character many times and even if I couldn't remember how to write it, I gave it a shot without peeking at the correct way.  It doesn't take all that long to get to the point where you will instinctively be able to read the kana as long as you're putting in some effort.  I probably spent a week on and off doing those lessons and writing them down until I was comfortable enough to do the normal lessons in kana only.  By that point you're reading the kana constantly during lessons and it gets easier.  Eventually when Kanji is introduced, I did the same thing.  I have a notebook filled with Kanji I've written down many times and now when I see them I recognize them easily.  Many people will recommend something like Anki instead, and it is a very useful tool, but for me personally writing things on a piece of paper really reinforces it into my brain.

Good luck!"

Opening up the Practice Kanji section shows me now only ~5 Kanji per unit, whereas before I was at 19/20 units in Explorer and like you said, from 12 or 13 onwards it was ~25 Kanji per unit which was quite overwhelming given a lot were very complex (洗濯、掃除、部屋、etc).

For context as well, I'm now somehow halfway through Traveller, and Duo is showing me words in reviews that I never learned, since there's now 20 more units that were slotted in before the unit I was on which is a little frustrating."

Because since I am a super user which makes gliding easy and clocking XPs easier, duolingo places me in the same absurd leagues everytime based on my XPs, where the top 3 have 7-10k xp (I'm in emerald). So yeah, except gliding through lessons I share the same frustration for XPs, it's just going to place you with users who can match or exceed your XP potential if you want to rise in leagues.

Once the little progress bar under all of the kanji in a unit fills up, you get slightly less writing practice exercises (and more “what is this kanji’s meaning/pronunciation”) but you should still be getting some. Like, for the kanji I’ve mastered, I can still get stroke order exercises but not as frequently (since I should presumably know it). 

That being said, I have started using a different app for learning kanji that I like quite a bit. It’s called Kanji! on the iOS store and the app icon is 字. It has more of a spaced repetition thing going on. Only the first level is free but unlocking all of the levels is only $11 so we’ll worth it if you like it imo"

It didn't help that the gem counter wasn't displayed on my interface during the ""3 days of Super for free"" they threw at me twice.

The limiting factor to my Duolingo experience wasn't the ""5 hearts per day limit"". I frankly only ran out of hearts twice in 38 days... once because it refused answers where I placed the time component first in the sentence and the other for silly things (not picking a determinant in the English translation of a listening exercise, missing ""ima"" a couple of times, one block of text that wouldn't be picked until I tried clicking just outside its container). I finished most days with 5 hearts.

On day 30, I started going back to the Anki/Migaku/Morphman trinity... eight days later, I fully stopped going to Duolingo.

I'd rather spend time learning vocabulary to increase my understanding of the media I'm consuming than learning how to ask Hana-san if she's going to do yoga in the park with her girlfriend next week Tuesday at 9:30.

Duolingo may or may not get more interesting in higher sections, but I'm not willing to grind through the rest of Section 2 to find out if Section 3 is more to my liking. ;)

The Migaku stack costs the same as the Duolingo Super subscription and lets me take control of the vocabulary I study."

Also I don't use Duolingo the traditional way, it's too slow when you have to keep doing the words you already know, I usually test out the units rather than doing each lesson 5 times, later if I need more work on a unit I'd do legendary lessons or the reviews lessons. It's slow and easy going and that's exactly why I'm using it, since it helps great on days or weeks when I'm burnt out of reviewing my anki cards, or binge watching language learning videos, or tired of searching new kanji through dictionaries or  learning from anime instead of just enjoying it."

So you start with something like ""Neko ga suki desu.""
And it would change to ""Neこ が suき desu"" once you learn かきくけこ.
Then ""Neこ が すき deす"" once you learn the さしすせそ row of the chart. 
It forces you to remember in the moment while giving some context clues, and eventually, you have everything in kana. 


It's a bit slow, taking up the whole first book (of 5) on hiragana, the second on katakana, and only starting in on kanji in the third book. But the most important part is finding a method that works for you, and if this unconventional method works, it works."

> learning from anime instead of just enjoying it

Yup that's why I flipped the script around. Now I use Anki only to preload the vocabulary upfront and raw immersion is the reward ;)

For example, I'm currently watching a slice of life anime series. I increased my comprehension  to 95% on season 1 in 12 days. This is where watching raw gets really enjoyable and I can start listening to the dialogs without having to focus too much.

Season 2 has 4 episodes not yet released, so I'm going to start learning the vocabulary for it soon.

If I decide to remain at 95%, I would just need 81 new words for the episodes that were already released. I would probably be done preloading the vocabulary on Monday or Tuesday, and would need to wait the rest of the week to get new words to study from the next episode.

If I aim for 96%, I would need to learn 155 new words for the episodes that were already released. I would be done preloading in less than a week and would still need to wait a few days each week for a new episode to drop.

If I aim for 97%, I would need to learn 268 new words for the episodes that were already released. At 20 new cards/day, I will run out of vocab and need to wait in about 2 weeks (depending on the difficulty of the next 4 episodes).

If I aim for 98%, I would need 434 new words for the episodes that are already out. I would take about just above 3 weeks at 20 cards/day and just above 2 weeks at 30 cards/day. This means I should be able to watch a new raw episode every two to three days (at 20 cards/day), and get new episodes/vocab before running out.

If I aim for 99%, I would need 617 new words for the episodes that are already out. I would take about a month at 20 cards/day or 3 weeks at 30 cards/day. This means the rest of the season gets released before I run out of vocabulary to study. However, there would be 4 to 5 days of preloading between raw episodes.

97% to 98% would be good targets for this cycle. If I actually go for 98%, I will change the global target to either a different style of anime or to books after this cycle. There are a few long running Light Novel series I'd like to read."
