It is the first of a three part investigation into Macron, Biden and Putin respectively. 

The first episode details how Strava, a social network for athletes that tracks GPS location, has been used without oversight by members of Macron's security team. 
Inadvertent public sharing on Strava has allowed the journalists to track Macron's location abroad, guess which hotels he was going to stay at in advance, and even locate his movement patterns in Paris. 

Furthermore, the agents shared personal information like photos with their families, allowing them to be identified in spite of the security protocols surrounding them, opening them up as targets to compromise the president's safety.

These mistakes seem to have been replicated by Biden and Putin's security teams."

This is a extreme example how the lack of awareness re:privacy reveals the information of other people and even puts them in danger.

Take Vladi. He is known to not use modern tech exactly for these reasons. Well, it turns out that his bodyguards haven't been so mindful undermining all their boss efforts. 

The same happens with all of us."

There are devices with privacy/tactical functions, like Garmin Tactix, they are already ubiquitous among armed forces. They (or the respective user accounts) could be altered to completely disable location upload and integration with other online services, and then the organizations could hand them out ot service members free (as part of the uniform) and ban any other type of device and online service. Thus problem can be solved. Anyone with a smart watch either has an approved model or it is confiscated on the spot, put in a Faraday cage to be given back when the owner is on leave. 

Btw Garmin Connect has a granular privacy configuration, while on Strava it's all or nothing. But it does not matter, as long as these companies can produce anonymous ""heat maps"" it should be a strict ""no upload"" policy for all armed forces, does not matter if it's Biden's detail or just the local sheriff or municipial police. It's a liability in both cases."

",Cumulus-Crafts,https://i.redd.it/zgrq1idlkbrd1.png,darrensurrey,"I thought I had the answer (wash body, wash underneath, wax on top because you won't be able to properly wax underneath - if you want to protect the chassis, lift up the car and waxoyl it).

But then I decided to google ""triple foam"" and now I have questions I'd ask the operative:

Tri-foam types

The conditioner/cleaner: Tri-foam works as a soap to help clean the vehicle while typically providing a shine. This product has surfactants similar to those in the other soap products.

The clear coat polish: Tri-foam acts as a wax-type product. It protects the vehicle while causing the water to sheet or bead off the surface. This product uses mineral seal oil, carnauba wax or non-oil based raw material to provide the benefits of a wax-type protectant. For carwashes with reclaim systems, special care should be taken to select the oil-free tri-foam.

Conditioner/cleaner plus tri-foam with additives: These tri-foams have additives such as bug remover or glass cleaner.

Winter formula tri-foam: This tri-foam is made with a non-freeze benefit. The winter formula product allows operators to offer the same look for their top wash in the cold as they do when the weather is above 32 degrees.

So, in fact, I'd just drive off with a dirty car."

You price a cup of coffee at £2 because you think that's how much your customers will pay. But you also think that some customers are willing to pay more, but you don't want to put off the ones who won't pay more. So a splash of oat milk, which costs you fractions of a penny, is 20p, for example. What you're actually doing is saying ""I think I can charge £2.20 for a coffee and people will pay.""

This car wash reckons people will pay up to £19 for a wash, but that most people will only want to pay a fiver."
"Where's the line between the point where the car wash is worth the money, and the point where you're just paying for useless extras? ",Cumulus-Crafts,https://i.redd.it/zgrq1idlkbrd1.png,rwinh,">There's a game with customer choice and having three options. Two isn't enough, Four starts heading into choice paralysis. If there are three price options people take the middle one, so you set up three just for that factor.

It's incredibly similar to the Goldilocks Principle in marketing - too little, too much and just right. Supermarkets were used as an example, with budget, mid-range and luxury product placement and price points. It's been butchered beyond recognition nowadays due to a range of factors (apps and loyalty schemes come to mind). It used to be more aimed towards consumers and their psychological wants and needs.

Today, businesses take these wants and needs, and apply the principle to squeeze more out the middle ""just right"" zone by seemingly adding more for less when the reality is less was not worth it and the more is just a reworded just-right, which is what this car wash is doing based on your analysis.

In theory, the Diamond Wax looks like the favourable option alongside Triple Foam. Some will see the deal in Triple Foam and think that's the standard and go with it, and others will see the £2 extra for wax as an affordable luxury and ""why not"" option. The Eco Wash is interesting as £5 for what you could do at home seems a bit strange but then it's affordable, with Triple Foam being a ""what the heck does that even mean""? option which is cancelled out by the Deal (£5.25 with the app)."

Any polishing that’s worth having will cost you more than £19. If it’s less than £50, just don’t bother. Even there, it’s likely not doing any real ‘polishing’. Save your money… When you say ceramic coating or ‘rain guard’, I assume you mean the cheap spray on, wipe off products rather than an actual ceramic coating sealant or wax. These are just fine, but are very different to a full blown ‘coating’ or proper wax.

You gets what you pays for. Most people won’t mind too much and that’s fine, but you can’t expect the world for £19. My local detailer charges £40 for a maintenance wash - just a wash and dry along with a squirt of top-up protection. It will be actually clean after this, though and no extra damage to the paint!"

However for monitors people really want high refresh rates too, trying to push high refresh rates *and* a high resolution is very taxing on your GPU.

1440p is a nice intermediate between FHD and UHD that gives a better resolution whilst also not being too taxing allowing running at high refresh rates

Most monitors are like 24-27 inches too where at that size and that close to the screen there's not much of a benefit using 4k

So 1440p are very popular for monitors but essentially don't exist for TV's

Someone made a chart a while ago showing the ""optimal"" viewing distances and sizes for each screen size and resolution if I can dig it up. Roughly it's 24 inches for 1080p, 27 inches for 1440p and 32inches+ for 4k

I'm not sure what point you're trying to make really. Obviously cycling isn't perfect all the time, but nor is any transport mode. It's drivers that dominate our street space however, and as a group cause about five deaths a day in the UK.

I don't think we should be encouraging more people to drive, I do think we should be encouraging more people to cycle (and building the infrastructure to make that easier)."

But I'm not here for an argument about the morals of cycling vs driving. Just pointing out how unrealistic that advert is, in the same way you called out car adverts for being unrealistic. 

I've commuted by bicycle in the past, and all the things I mentioned were from experience. I stopped doing it after getting knocked off my bike for the third time by a car. It was simply safer to be the one with a cage around myself before I ended up seriously injured or dead.

You can encourage as many people as you want, but not everyone can use a bicycle. And those will still pose a danger to cyclists. Sadly, there isn't the money or space in this country for effective infrastructure to protect cyclists without banning motor vehicles altogether."

I struggle with recognizing that I'm a good person and worthy of love and something this small is all it takes to help me to feel good about myself. 

Yes, it's mainly selfish reasons that I love and support this app but, it also put humanity into society and for fuck sake, we need as much of that as we can get lately."

That's wonderful,ComfortableScratch80,https://i.redd.it/869wc8wxa91c1.jpg,LindseyIsBored,"I love Be My Eyes! I get a call about once a month. Some of the calls take a long time - I’ve helped a man navigate through a mall to find a store that ended up being closed and I continued to help him navigate to find an alternative store. I’ve also helped a woman sift through an entire bag of beads and color coordinate them. Some calls are short - like helping someone choose the right color sweater. 

Every call has been rewarding. 

It really makes you realize all of the shit that’s in the way of the normal pathway for blind people - tables, trash cans, flower pots, and the small spaces we expect those who can’t see to navigate."

So you might need a cane to get round, but you can read, so you never learned to read braille, so it's harmful if someone starts posting all correspondence to you in braille.

We absolutely SHOULD NOT ASSUME they want or need help. 

People deserve their own autonomy regardless of their health situation and they don't need random folks like you or I presuming in our own heads what they do or don't need.

There is nothing wrong with asking another person if they would like assistance with something - forcing your ""help"" on them is never okay."

Like she might find it easier to get her emails/texts (main source of parent communication now) read through a text to voice app but just the smily face threw her, she might not want to deal with setting aside the time for a phone appointment for this info to be passed on verbally, she might deal fine 99% of the time and simply cba to go through the admin of requesting assistance.

Performance varies with hardware diffs, but there's obviously performance issues that need to be fixed/patched out.

The bigger issue imo is the Story tho. Tbf the beginning story for most Gachas are pretty bland/mid to bad in general, but WW's is exceptionally bad with subpar voice-acting (no offense to the VAs/was directors fault) and long-winded exposition (even for world/character introduction beginning), coupled with Yangyang (unironically competing with Paimon for worst partner 💀). Tbf I heard story potentially picks up with Scar and can obviously get better in future patches, but first impression of story atm is a damn shame. A~~t least in future patches, might be able to skip it at least since Devs mention improving on Skip feature💀~~

Bugs and Initial Story aside, there's still potential with their combat as the fluidity and quick-responsiveness of controls/combos feels good/fun with complexity for rotations. Of course actual combat difficulty isn't particularly hard atm since it's against story content/not invested enough to properly access endgame combat/difficulty, so that's yet to be seen.

Exploration is ehhh since it's def a lot better/faster to explore everywhere thanks to infinite stamina + parkour, but current areas are relatively bland/samey atm. Could just be initial/starting area being relatively basic, but hopefully new areas get more interesting.

Overall WW def deserves to be ridiculed for its poor launch, but it's not dead at launch like others makes it out to be as long as Devs quickly fix the bugs/optimization issues for smoother experience for the gameplay and improve the story and voice-acting to be more impactful/interesting."

For all the complaints Wuwa is getting there’s at least no spyware accusations.

But they fucked it up by making all of Genshin’s bad areas even worse, doing nothing but maybe combat better. But between the awful story and performance most people would never make it to endgame to fully enjoy it. Doesn’t help that they jacked up the rng needed for good gear significantly compared to Genshin thanks to having 2 main stats and 5 sub stats per item."

This is the sort of stuff you're never ever going to see outside of China or with the CC's otherwise since as you say they are absolutely acting as a filter of any legitimate criticism of the game and trying to shut it down entirely wherever possible. Many of whom are the same people always going on about how they never trust a corporation and that they must always be up to no good when you switch a few of the consonants around in the short form name of the company being talked about.  Just absolutely extraordinary levels of bias from the English gacha CC community when it comes to this game.  The Chinese marketing doesn't seem to have done through a middleman group of sponsored CC's in China like it has been in the American market though so everything is just kind of raw and unfiltered and laid bare as ever.

Like the English CC's did not seem to distinguish between the two concepts at all and just seem to figure more hype action stuff happening and FMV's playing during the boss fight climax=better storytelling like English speakers always do with that sort of thing in anime nowadays.

Let's see what else...yeah the game clearly had a worse opening week on the IOS charts then not only Genshin and HSR, but even Tower of Fantasy and recent upstarts like Legend of Mushroom, Solo Leveling and [Dungeon Fighter Origins](https://app.sensortower.com/overview/1529851592?country=CN) (China only), which came out the same day, but I admittedly didn't know it had a colder opening than Reverse:1999 even since I didn't catch that games opening week at the time since admittedly I wasn't that interested.

It'll never not be kind of funny to me that I pretty much always know more about what's actually going on in the otaku/weeb scene both domestically and in Asia than ever of these CC's ever will period, probably till the day I die.   Like these people don't know fucking shit about what they are talking about most of the time or are twisting thing in bad faith on purpose, but pretty often it's the former I can tell.

Personally feeling after finishing the main story quest and general gameplay is that its pretty much average quality of genshin.  The story low parts just matches the likes of kokomi part of the archon quest.  I mean that is pretty bad for a launch but understandable if they rush rewrote the thing since CBT2, and there is a skip button.  I guess the game just is mid enough to hold some attention but not good enough to actually praise without embarrassment.

As for developers listening to players, there is having empathy and giving players what they'd like, and there is malicious compliance that uses feedback as a weapon.  In the case of omnipandering games feedback is almost impossible due to different player bases fighting and radical rhetoric used to ""overpower"" the other side."

Maybe if the community hadn't complained they could have fixed the game's fine details within that time. Just because players were anticipating the game's release they released the game . They even said dev talk they spend more time in QOLs and Echos optimization just because Kuro listened to players feedback. Now if the players are not happy with ww thats their problem not kuro, they r pumping out updates after updates every day knowing that their r problems in the game and acknowledging it and solving it unlike a certain game where nothing of the community is being listened to.
They just need more time to fine tune the game to the player standards cuz apart from animation details, fine tuning of the graphics , game optimization,and story error are dependent on how much time is spent on each of these cases other than that everything is OK.

P.S: i dont know much about their company and how they manage their stuff internally. I have played their game Punishing Gray Raven and i can say that the current game wuthering waves need more time to reach the same level as PGR."

When comparing to Genshin's strengths (exploration, story, and music), Wuwa can't reach that level of quality, and their strong point is combat and movement. Anyone expecting Wuwa to match Genshin's quality was dreaming... Did China feel the same about ToF too?

The story is average (the part where he puts the military's commands in the rover's hands I really think shouldn't exist.)

She stopped playing even before getting to the combat.........

Yes they should’ve worked out bugs before launch and the VA should’ve been shown to even just a group of 10 people for feedback lol, but if you have a halfway decent phone or pc it runs just fine and you wind up just dealing with things like text overflow and switching to a different va (which is what you should do with any gacha game imo)."

Anyway the combat and movements are already enough for me to put this way ahead of Genshin, dunno what CN is smoking."

The combat does look pretty fun so I think it could end up being a solid game eventually, but feels like poor management decisions are hurting it: pushing the game out before it was ready, going cheap on the EN dub/localization, overreacting to critical feedback instead of having confidence in creative decisions (going from one extreme to the other with the story), etc."

Because at Hoyo's level of player base/ scale, 'listening' to players is a dimwit's errand. And far harder to do than scratching their customers unknown itches (like ARPG (Honkai 3rd) and open world (Genshin))

I'll just yap my thoughts here if you don't mind so I don't clog this sub with even more WuWa threads.

For transparency I've explored all the areas (though I haven't done much world quests), unlocked like 80% of the teleporters, and stopped playing before I met Jiyan because I just lost interest at that point.

I tried giving it a fair chance, attempted to read most of the story only to find myself checking out after 3 hours. It was so goddamn tiring to read. The last time I ever felt like this was with Arknights CNY events.

Scar may be one of the first *coherent* NPC that you meet, in the sense that he just doesn't throw jargons at you, but he ended up being pretty ass.

With WuWa's characters in general I just don't feel anything from them man, both characterization and design-wise. I used Rover and Mortefi the entire time because those 2 are the only ones that I liked (and have). I still don't know what Rover's character is supposed to be, the choice you're given are somewhere between playing it safe like Genshin and snappy sarcastic memer like HSR, except most NPC reactions are the same, but then there's that one time you're talking with Scar where you suddenly just spout proverbs to respond to him? Brother what. 

ALSO there's that one time, I forgot when, but basically it just zooms to Rover's face every time you pick a dialogue option and it looked jank as hell, made for a few good laughs but holy fuck.

Combat and the whole pokemon thing was pretty good. Being able to use bosses for attacks/open world transversal was very cool, kinda made me wish the game had a proper mount system instead because I kept spamming the fire bike boss. Chaining your summons with your character combos and character switch attacks was fun and satisfying. These features could honestly carry the game for me, if the game's performance were at least stable.

There are different terrains on the world but most of them felt pretty dull. Couple that with how ass the music is in this game (despite the whole damn thing being based around sound and music???) and it gave me a newfound appreciation for soundtrack and art direction in open world games, both gachas and non-gachas.

I don't see it ever happening, but if they rework the starting experience again I'm honestly down to reinstall and try it all over again. But this is no Cyberpunk or No Man's Sky, or even FFXIV with their 'Blow up the world and start from scratch' solution. There's no 'second try' for a live-service gacha I feel. 

It was an overall 6.5/10 for me... As a beta game. As a full release, yikes."

I always found the combat so interesting: the skills are simple by themselves, but there are many ways to build a team and combine your skills. But they just never gave us anything to really explore the combat potential. Abyss was always just a dps check. Open world was just one shotting trash mobs. ""Difficulty"" came in the form of introducing bosses with long invulnerably phases to eat timers.

This is basically why I'm not even going to bother with wuthering waves, or any genshin clone for that matter. It's why I finally quit genshin too. I really really really enjoy the combat, but I don't see any company trying to make meaningful encounters for the combat. It's not really a gacha game problem; it's something I've seen across gaming in general: the dumbing down of gameplay. Complaining about it gets you the: ""eVeRy GaMe IsN't DaRk SoULs"" kind of response, because wanting any more complexity than nuking the screen suddenly means you want dark souls."

I have a rather good PC (Ryzen 2700X, RTX 3090), and didn't really have any performance problems. I encountered some bugs, but nothing game-breaking for me. But well, it's obvious that for many, performance is a real issue right now.

The story is really pretty meh. The appearance of a certain character in Act III makes you think that it is going to get more interesting, but then, the story plays out exactly as boringly as before.

Exploration is also kinda whatever. There are some nice parts, but mostly, it feels like Genshin, but mediocre. There is also at least one puzzle that is also just straight-up a Star Rail ripoff.

So yeah... it's ok. In most cases, people are better off playing Genshin since it does most things better than WuWa, but if you don't like Genshin or are taking a break from Genshin, it's fun enough for a while."

I think wuwa's plot is significantly worse, but its combat is significantly better. Genshin had slightly better music, Wuwa has much better traversal, which makes the exploration much less boring and much more interesting.

My favorite content in both games so far has been the character sidestories where you hang out with the gacha characters. Although Wuwa doesn't have a lot of those yet, Genshin didn't really have a lot of them either on launch. They only released a bunch of them years into the game's cycle, after the devs realized they were popular.

I haven't experienced optimization issues outside of Epic launcher being the worst, but my PC is quite overtuned for these games so I do believe that it exists.

---

Anyways, the reason I got burned out of Genshin was because the combat was super simple and got super boring and repetitive. Doing a fight once was fine but doing the same fight 500 times to farm artifacts got super boring and tiresome.

Wuwa is definitely much higher skill ceiling and fast paced, I can see myself playing this game for longer. We'll see how it all shakes out. I'm hoping the plot of Wuwa gets less cringe in the next chapter, and optimization issues get fixed, and then it might actually be a good game."

It is better than genshin in some ways, worse in others, and it is not as polished for sure. It blows every gacha not made by hoyo out of the water, and with some polish it will be the first serious competitor to genshin. I believe this is why there is so much negativity about it right now, because it's the first gacha to come out with the potential to compete with genshin.

Even some CCs have noticed some odd follower behavior popping up in their channels, which seems like there is some astroturfing going on.

As to whether or not it will come close to Hoyo to make them be worried, likely not. While hardcores love to claim how it is the gameplay that matters the most and how new competitors that has better gameplay would completely destroy Genshin, that is just not true. Most Genshin players, the silent majority play the game for everything else. So Hoyo knows that even if they lose in the combat aspect, people would still go and stick with them for the story and everything else.

Just look at their revenue. Consistently strong despite the lack of endgame for hardcores.

Plus, what people don't realize is that even if WuWa might be able to come close, their method isn't something to be aped as it is a terrible practice. Mismanagement of everything that lead to rushed product and bad first impression. Hoyo could just simply said, ""don't be like Kuro who listened to players too much that they killed their own vision.

It was like why are you asking me dude?, you’re the goddamn General. Then I just chose wrong answers to see, yep he would repeat until you picked the right answer. I knew it was suppose to be front line lines, but I said split up and flank.

I had no idea what they were doing that last act, it picked up in intensity but it felt foreign in some way. No attachment onto why the motivations of some characters shifted within 3 acts.

Also hilarious the lion dancing dude being on the top of the tower dancing in the cinematic preparing for war, it was so off, felt like lampooning the goddamn genre. Or the guy we might earn in a week or two via the Tower, that dude shows up in the cutscene like we know this mofo, like “Hew in the blue fuck are you? Michael Jackson Moonwalker Gacha is that way ==>”

Holy shit I just had an epiphany, if the devs made WuWa into a Genshin Clone parody by going off the walls meme territory by using every trope possible, I seriously would buy into that premise. Just go ham doing absurdity and make fun of doing the most basic shit. I know it will not happen but the way CN is acting they have dug themselves a hole not easy to get out of.

They could give us the next 10 limited banners free, and it wouldn’t appease this backlash. The snowball effect has started going downhill and has reached a huge boulder size that Kuro games is not ready to get hit with the impact.

But the way the trailblazer was treated made sense in the context of the story.  While I thought it was pretty stupid how everyone treated him/her with such familiarity despite barely having any screentime with them, the way the trailblazer fit in to the story at least *made sense*.  To a fault, almost, they were basically a background character the whole time.

And in recent patches Genshin has nailed the Traveler's role in things.  While they are big players in the story, they're always shown as spectators who play their part when needed and never the central piece to any of the stories.  Inazuma was always all about Raiden and the way she dealt with her grief (Though execution was a bit lacking), Sumeru was always all about Nahida and her imprisonment despite her best intentions, Fontaine was always all about Furina and her lonely struggle for a prophecy that she doesn't even know is true.  Traveler was part of these stories, yes, but they were never the main attraction.

I don't even know what to say about the Rover.  It just comes off as really dumb Mary Sue power fantasy."

The only thing they committed to was lore/world building which while nice is really not very motivating as a driving thing to gamble on gatcha. Role-playing super fans are in heaven with genshin, people who want a gatcha action rpg may have found something better in wuthering now. Genshin copied the gatcha genre but introduced a new formula that has others copying it, namely having more than a turn based card game attached to a slot machine. 

You won't find a genshin-like game without steep farming and time sinks. What would keep people playing while waiting for slowly developed content? 

You are simply playing the wrong genre if you 1. Don't like having to wait for energy refills and 2. Maybe not getting the character you want without spending money/being extremely conservative with free currency. I also throw in the inclusion of RNG as hell farming and tedious resource gathering/daily refreshes to just be what you get for gatcha games.

Would abyss floor 13 or Samurai warriors be good enough endgame? Instead they rolled out several events and got feedback to create this new endgame mode. It is an end game mode focused on elemental reactions which is the core of its combat system.

I enjoyed the combat in WW but the random stuttering on my PC detracts from it yet I am able to play small scale BDO node wars in remastered mode with 120 fps.

However, I play on mobile alot and it crashes often on my s22 yet I am able to run PGR just fine on it. I hope Kuro resolves these issues quickly."

That means they have a very talented developer team, an insane management staff and most importantly, a lot of money to keep up with the cost. Kuro, or other companies have to better or on par with Mihoyo in these requirements if they want to compete and ""dethrone"" Genshin.


But what i said is big ""if"" WW was getting the same opportunity as Genshin. But in reality it is not. The opportunity for Mihoyo was what Chinese idiom called ""the harmony between heaven, earth and human"". In one hand, we have a pandemic once a century event, everyone stay home and want something to kill time and distract themselves from the fact that people is dying left and right while their future is uncertain. The chip shortage make many people want to play game but don't have good PC, console to play them and resort to mobile games. Stimulus package of government in many countries mean people, especially the ones with bad financial management want to spend. In other hand, Mihoyo bet big on a high quality open world gacha game, a thing that not guaranteed success, especially when they release it simultaneously on all regions( CN, JP, KR, GLOBAL). That would increase a lot of operating costs and paperwork, law etc.., while they don't know how the Global (western audience) would love an anime style game( especially from China with current geopolitical tensions),despite they need to tap into the boarder audience, the ones that sweaty hardcore gatekeeper called ""normies"" because they are huge, the more people play the game> more people pay> more revenue to keep up with the live service development cost. Another gamble is they developed the game from 2017 but with the graphics in mind that the game would be for the 2020 devices, if it doesn't play out and genshin made same problems like WW did today, maybe Genshin would flop.


But well, Cai Haoyu and Da wei bet big and they won big, the game release smoothly and successful, even more than what they imagined. And with that big stream of money come in, they change the development direction of the game to be bigger, more ambitious ( just look at the first two regions compared to inazuma, then sumeru and fontine, the scale and quality is much better, and now they're cooking natlan). It's a clear example of ""don't sleep on victory"". That can achieved because they are private, the founders of Mihoyo is the one that made decisions, they are good friends and very enthusiastic about their jobs. The thing maybe different in public companies that decisions in hand of shareholders, and they only care about money.


Talk back about WW. WW don't get the same opportunity like Genshin did. The pandemic is gone and everything becomes normal. Since 2020 till now many things happened, wars, geopolitics tensions make economy recessed, especially in China which is the biggest market, where the decoupling of western companies make many Chinese people lose job hence less spending. That's not to mention the biggest factor is they're not the first stepper anymore but is competing against the well established giants that's Genshin, which already had a wellworked development pipeline, loyal playerbase and especially, Mihoyo have a big pocket they can spend. 


What i said in those three paragraphs is what Kuro and WW would face even  if things go smoothly, however, their release is much worse than i thought, to the point it's like a crash. The game is rushed, clearly not ready to release yet. Now they have to bear a big burden of fix the problems but at the same time developing new contents, but the revenue is much lower than they thought. Can they do these things is hard to know but the future is pretty grim, especially with how much we see over at CN server"

It should be released some months later to fix bugs and optimization.

I do agree that at core it's a solid game that can be entertaining, especially the combat, however, I do think the root cause is still trying to one up a game but with only a shallow understanding of why it was successful, and lacking a core concept that makes the game ""its own thing"", and at least half of the problems they are currently facing originates from being built on those sloppy fundations."

A lot of its issues can be boiled down to ""not meeting expectations"", whether in plot or optimization, which means that the game will be better recieved once they tackle those.

It's not out of the ordinary to have a terrible first patch. Star Rail was abysmal to play during 1.1 - 1.3, Genshin had an unimpressive first arc in Monstadt, and so on. What matters is how they'll recover from those, and I bet WuWa can ball."

On the one hand, running up walls is cool, on the other hand, it devalues the terrain and the journey.

In Genshin, climbing up Liyue's highest mountain is one of my favorite gaming moments in the last few years, also because of the godly music (personally, I think Genshin's music is MILES better than WuWa's), because it looked fantastic and heavenly, and because it felt like an formidable obstacle that you slowly overcome. I love going up mountains in real life, and I loved it in Genshin as well. So when instead of having that experience, you just run up the mountain, the mountain just isn't anything special anymore."

So you figured they would be against things that would decrease gambling. And then Hoyo became stingy with their pulls and then suddenly everyone is ok with the chance to gamble.

What's even more ironic is that this is something that a lot of Genshin players realized during the first anniversary fiasco. During that time, everyone want more pull, but when they began to attack outsiders and innocents, I made them rethink ""are we seriously doing all this and reduce the game and more importantly, ourselves to just pulls?"" So most of the players after that didn't care about the pulls so much anymore. You can see 2nd and 3rd anniversary where a repeat of the fiasco was attempted and it didn't happen.

Meanwhile, those that didn't share this mentality are willing to ignore everything and reduce their game to just pulls. Nothing else matters to them."

Release a CBT 2 which is pretty much a different game still with issues and then we end that CBT fix half of them and then gaslight everyone else about problems with the game.

We proceed to fix nothing and then publish that buggy game. In the following weeks we will be giving out free pulls and promises that we’ll “do better” while just hiring and firing more people behind the scenes and getting some freelance fiverr devs to begin work on the next region.

Which also means no one will give the new game a chance, and thus no revenue will be built to then improve the game, meaning only genshin will ever be playable. And since it’ll have a monopoly, they’ll continue to ignore their players and give out piss poor rewards and compensation.  

That being said, wuwa itself is pretty much dead in the water at this point with all the drama. CN and JP, the largest regions, are done with the game. And tbf, Kuro deserves this big L at this point as they keep screwing up. Between leaking emails, bugs, the story, the English va, the echo xp and tuner situation, etc… well people have had enough.

Once Natlan comes out, it's curtains for me and Waves. I don't even hate the latter here.

I tried to get into WW and went into it mostly blind (to the point I was unaware of all the discourse between it and genshin's fanbase up 'til launch), but this is just painful. From the disastrously poor English VA direction and unremarkable OST to a plot that is all over the place and crammed with jargon, I actually feel like throwing in the towel even after a few hours. 

The combat is great and the game runs fine on my PC (granted I'm on a beefier rig with a 4090), but nothing particularly blew me away in this game. I'm all for a Genshin alternative, but Waves is going to have to do better than this."

It is not told in a particularly novel or compelling way.

1.0 -1.2 in Genshin were very mid, mostly focusing on story updates, although 1.2. added Dragonspine, After that **there was no new region for almost an entirely year.** They added the summer islands in 1.6 which was a very small area, then Inazuma finally came out. That means that for the first 9 months of the game, the updates were very small. It was so bad that players had complained about Lantern Rite and Hoyo actually had to respond to their complaints, and 1.4 is notorious as the worst patch in the game's history **until recently.** They almost always go at least 2 patches in a row with no content; Genshin is notorious for filler patches, and the quality of the last few updates has declined greatly. Lantern Rite was a great update, but the next 2 updates after that were exceptionally mid, with 2 updates adding only one character each (not even a 4\*) and Chiori's patch being infamous as the worst in the game's history now, with no content, and a character who released who underperformed greatly.

The next patch is also a filler patch with only story updates and the new game mode Hoyo is adding **to incentivize rolling more, and to further shill the recent banner characters.**

At the end of the day, all Hoyo cares about is money. Their developers are not as passionate as you pretend they are, they often ignore their fans and like most other games are run by corporate greed. But the main point of what I'm saying is that Hoyo tends to have very, very dry months in Genshin that allow them to prepare for new areas, it's like x.0\~x.3 are usually the best patches of a new region, then every patch after that is waiting for the next one.

And the quality of the events in Genshin is very bad. The alchemy event (again, Chiori's banner) has to be one of the laziest in Genshin in a long time, but there are also other events from last year like Freminet's event which is a glorified hangout/character quest (he has no hangout), etc. 

I'm not saying any of this to dunk on Hoyo or complain, but I just wanted to play devil's advocate a bit because Hoyo is definitely not a magical, fun-loving company that keeps pace with a sadistic release schedule. They know exactly what they are doing and now have 3 years of practice, the first year of genshin was a travesty when it came to quality updates."

The old Lingyang tracks down a boss he's sworn to kill. Yang Yang and Rover is tasked with helping him. From the start Lingyang makes it clear to Rover that he neither trusts nor respects them and questions their combat ability.   
 
The three gets to the boss, *the boss Lingyang sworn to defeat*, and Lingyang asks us, *the person who he just expressed his distrust in*, to fight the boss with Yang Yang while he clears out the mobs.  
 
We fight the boss, there's an epic battle at the end of which this cutscene plays. The boss and Rover clashes and separates as both are knocked back. Lingyang charges in from nowhere, and then one shots the gravely weakened boss, kill stealing it. Yang yang goes, ""wow what great timing! We couldn't have done this without you! You are amazing for doing this"".    
   
The little shit even asks you, ""did I really land the last hit?"" and then goes on about how he finally defeated his sworn enemy but why does he feel so empty? (No shit, we did all the hard work). At no point does he thank you or acknowledge your effort in this. Then after the dialogue ends you can talk to him again, and he has the nerve to say ""why are you still here?""."

I played Star Rail since launch at it was really good back then as well and was generally praised highly by everyone to be one of the best gacha game launches ever.

Also, to fix the WuWa story problems, they will basically need to replace the entire beginning of the game, which will be rough. If later story parts are better written, it only solves half the problem, because every new player will need to go through the bad parts first. And the difference is that in WuWa, the current first story chapters are just really uninteresting, even below the ""meh"" level."

Star Rail was abysmal to play during 1.1 - 1.3, Genshin had an unimpressive first arc in Monstadt, and so on. What matters is how they'll recover from those, and I bet WuWa can ball.

The problem is you aren't competing against HSR and Genshin in 1.0-1.3. You're competing with them _right now_. Sure you can't compete in quantity no one can expect that reasonably, but you should be competing in quality. 

The entire core selling point of ""An open world!"" is unoriginal and bad _because of being unoriginal_ because it feels like it shouldn't be there. It's a tacked on shallow experience solely because they wanted to compete with Genshin instead of actually taking their good combat system and doing something with it. They decided to make an uninspired boring world to explore and designing it for the Genshin hater crowd who thinks ""I dont like exploring why do they want me to play the game"". So exploring was watered down to nothing so people could just move on. 

Unoriginal doesn't always mean bad, but unoriginal = bad when you're being unoriginal solely to try and siphon an audience with such blatant direct copying."

is this how WW players cope now, by rewriting history? Genshin and HSR on launch were smooth, or at least decent to play on almost all devices they were advertised to be able to run, and that's why they caught on quick. They don't have gamebreaking bugs that players can't open the game lol. And while the opening arc of both GI and HSR as a whole was nothing to write home about, it managed to hook players by being simple and straight to the point, plus great music that just lives rent free in players' head. WW did none of that, the opening arc is complicated with lots of terms for no reason (it could unironically use a Paimon here), and the music is just forgettable, which sucks because Kuro can make bangers from PGR"

That's just you. Please don't use your personal experience as representative of many or trying to rewrite history just to make WuWa look good. Genshin's story at launch did not have much problem at all and majority like it. 

Heck due to the story, it's impact was huge to players till today. It is considered to be the favourite region, which is why it tend to be priority in receiving special events such as the Golden Archipelago, which also many considered to be one of the best event.

Man playing Genshin after WuWa made me appreciate just how much detail given to the character by the dev and thier insight to it. The sound and the visual gives weight to it. 

The sound when character in Genshin does their skill makes it clear that you are doing something special. The visual also is distinguishably. With WuWa, a lot of the skill seems no different than normal attacks really. I'm was doing normal attacks then press skill and I went ""wait, that it?"" I mean their flame effects is nearly unnoticeable too in overworld.

Didn't help that the font size for the numbers are small so giving the idea that you are dealing pittance of a damage which actually is as a lot of combat would be you chipping at enemy's health. Genshin however put huge font size to tell you ""THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU DEAL! BE PUMPED!"""

I love hoyo and gacha games, I defend hoyo and fgo for their amazing games but I won't ever defend the predatory system of gacha. It's still something that turns you into an addict. Which is why I have great respect for players who make no wish accounts, mostly dain savers in genshin and Diamond savers in HSR or for any other character in general. I recently made a no wish account to save for a su expy in HSR and I realized it's so hard to control that addiction of pulling. At first it doesn't get you much. But as you see characters you like and want behind a banner that's gacha and requires you to farm thousands of primos/jades or just easily spend 1000 dollars to get, the system really draws you in and tempts you to spend money to get the characters you want.

 And that's when the companies which own such games start giving out freebies to keep the players from quitting the game, which in turn earns more players. The rewards are for people who are really into the game and to keep them from quitting. That's what wuwa is doing now. They give out free pulls and a standard 5 star selector and they know the players will keep playing for the rewards. Then they recently nerfed the standard dps, especially calcharo, who many guides advised to get and many players picked and even spent money for. It's a pretty shady yet neat strategy if you think about it. First, give away a 5 star selector which makes players stay, then nerf those characters. Which then makes the player force to pull other units to make them better. And guess who's banner is next? Yinlin. The unit calcharo synergieses well with. That's why giving rewards is not and should never be a metric for judging a game. No matter how much rewards they give out, if the game is terrible, then know they're just doing that to keep you in the game."

But recently they release S ranks back to back and you need all of them because they cover different area (Sena for lightning, Thelema for Ice, and Lantern is fire I guess since she hasn't been released in GLB). All Part 1 is in a grey zone of obsolesence because newer bosses cater part 2 gameplay but we still have Part 1 bosses that cater the latest Part 1 character.

If you asked about pvp aspect yes it still there, we even have a new pvp for the endgame players"

After the change of writers in chapter 20 something (part 1), I feel bored with the pseudoscience talk, it's just too much to me. No focus on character interactions, just on made up science stuff. But I'm really attached to the game, so I won't drop it soon.



Also, nope ,part 2 isn't really more f2p friendly, it was an illusion. At the same time they have farmable stigmata (memories from PGR but you only need 3), there are four S-ranks back to back already, breaking the usual alternated pattern of S rank, A rank the game used to have. You literally have to pull every patch if you want every character (before that it was possible to get all of the new ones with free gems, and a lot of weapons with the $5 monthly pack)."

The conversion from USD to my currency is what hampers me from spending on a game due to fluctuations.

This is I would say, one of many flaws of Kuro. They really have terrible insight of the future. Even if there would be some profit down due to the services of currency exchange, Hoyo knows that if they make it easy for players, they are more likely to spend. So they convert the currency to a player's and they make it easy to buy the monthly.

Kuro did the opposite with PGR during launched. They didn't convert and did not give the option to buy the monthly outright but instead have to do currency exchange.

And then they make it so that even the second lowest money package (lowest is 1dollar, the second is 4 or 5 dollar) is not enough to buy the monthly. You basically have to buy both 1 dollar and 4 dollar. People complained about this. So you know what Kuro did? Instead of reducing the monthly price so that it will be exact 4 dollar, they make two monthly. One is the unchanged price and one is the reduced price. I've never seen monthly difference before lol. Usually it's on the duration.

And of course they don't seem to convert the currency to local again with WuWa. With PGR I can understand because they are ""small time company,"" but this one? Yeah no.

Mind you that even other games are able to do this. Action Taimanin of all games are able to automatically convert their price so that I know exactly how much I'm paying."

You referencing the CURRENT mihoyo financial state when he is talking about Mihoyo BEFOFE genshin success, and when they only have HI3 and GGZ money to make genshin is really showing you don't know what you talking about.

Having her hand on the holster? I could EASILY see that from what is effectively a military Police officer on patrol finding someone very out of place.

On the other hand, the current story is ridiculous in how over-trusting the two are on meeting you, it's VERY much falling into the common Xianxia range of ""everyone is your simp, or everyone is your enemy"" writing, and it's just BAD writing both ways. There are fragments of good, the background worldbuilding itself is fine, outside of the unnecessary usage of ""new"" worldbuilding tech-terminology being *hammered into your skull* too fast when the plot hasn't had a chance to take hold FIRST, And I like how much the MC actually has to say when the..well ""supporting cast"" isn't present and overriding our own thoughts and making us choose-non answers to REALLY stupid questions. 

It's a bad sign when you WANT Paimon around to act as the idiot-ball carrier that needs to learn everything even though she's supposed to be the world guide.

And it makes sense. Most here know Mondstadt now so I don't need to go into details, but the traveler arriving there is just a foreign traveler coming into this peaceful region. The people there being welcoming in general is fine for the setting.

WuWa starting area tries to portray a fortified city on the border with an active war going on right in front of the city. Yangyang is basically Amber, both being outriders.

Yeah this has been my main concern regarding WuWa’s long term financial success. It already had its work massively cut out for it. 4.7 looking like a very meaty patch with a highly anticipated character, HSR still in its yearly hype period with a ridiculously anticipated Firefly (who also seems pretty whale-baity like Acheron), and ZZZ coming out a bit over a month later, a game that will inevitably steal the spotlight just on the basis of being a Hoyo game. Hell, that’s not even counting non-gacha releases like a little niche game called Elden Ring. Then Natlan comes out in 3 months and I genuinely do not think WuWa will stand a chance unless they literally just give everyone like 3 free 5 stars that month.

It had to compete with all of this, so this rough launch and negative CN reception is the LAST thing they need right now. I really don’t think the devs are having fun right now."

I'd put money on it! World and greater cosmology Background lore completed? Absolutely. Major cast members from all of the intended destinations made before the game ever released? I'd say close to 95% of the characters released so far were already created before launch, but not finalized til shortly before their release in the story. I'd say even the intended ending of the entirety of the Teyvat saga, and the Khaenri'ah/Dainsleif subplot is mostly written out already, even if the multiple Archon chapters to get there aren't even on paper yet.

But written? Not a damn chance, considering what we got for the Inazuma archon arc. What they've written falls within the lore, but that could not have been written in advance, or Inazuma would have been a COMPLETELY different story after the first chapter, without the dozen plot-holes and loose ends they left behind there, the shoddy character development, the whiplash pacing, and the absolute lack of empathetic character development for what SHOULD have been an important character death due to a major reveal about the Delusions."

This is my biggest issue with the game honestly. The technobabble is annoying, but it's not insurmountable and it's not unique at all to WW. Shit, even MHY fumbled the absolute fuck out of HI3's climax with stupid exposition dumps and the less said about Arknights' obtuseness, the better, for two examples.

But jesus WW even pretty much copy/pasted like 90% of Genshin's UI and menus. Character progression is virtually identical. They even copied the annoying shit from Genshin like having to go to one specific area to synthesize materials. Which is extra annoying since MHY realized that was a pointless annoyance when they got rid of it for HSR entirely and let you combine materials anywhere, even directly from the character upgrade menu. It's like they spent 100% of their brain power on making up as much technobabble as possible and 0% on trying to make the game its own thing. The actual combat gameplay and character designs are going to buy a couple of months for the game for me, but even being as optimistic as possible, I doubt I'm still playing it by the end of the year unless the endgame combat is on a different level. I already have PGR for that anyway I guess."

WoW was challenged for more than a decade by dozens of clones that attempted to do exactly what they did except worse.  This is exactly the same reason why the ""You can't compare 4.0 Genshin to 1.0 WW"" argument falls flat.  

A game offering competes in the current market, not in the past, and if you are offering a clone game to the market, you are always to going to be behind.  The first mover dominant competitor isn't just going to stop progressing once you enter the ring, and as a result you are always going to behind the curve.

Inevitably this results in players asking themselves, ""why would I play the bootleg copy when I can play the legitimate one?""  

While FFXIV ARR (2.0) was more successful than its 1.0, back then it was still far from being a rival to WoW because it was literally a WoW clone.  We know from the documentary that they ripped all of the concepts from WoW Cata.  They were even bleeding players during HW post patch because Alexander was too hard and casuals had no content. XIV only started challenging WoW for the top spot when they realized that they should be focusing on those casual players that make up 90%+ of the market instead of fighting for WoW over the 10% of hardcore raiders.

Thinking that you can compete 1:1 with the market leader while having significantly less resources and experience is sheer hubris."

Weapon banner being better isn't what you think it is. If you've played pgr, you'll know that signature weapons matter quite a bit lol sure you're guaranteed the weapon, but the weapon is also a lot more necessary. That's the trade off. Better system but the monkey paw is that the signature is much more necessary now. One step forward two steps backwards. 


This is especially true for WuWa right now because the alternative options are all incredibly mediocre. 


As for the combat, that's subjective. I play a lot of devil may cry so whenever I try these flashy ""fast paced"" mobile games, none of them ever really click for me cause they all just feel incredibly shallow by comparison to what I'm used to. 


the combat is just pgr but they took out the orb system. So they couldn't even really make a new combat system for their new game and had to just recycle PGR's? At the very least Hoyo made GI and Hi3 extremely different types of combat systems.

So you have some open worlds to do and several stuff from story. I honestly love the story up to chapter 25, mainly the domination arc (chapters 23-25 iirc). After that, you enter the Elysian Realm lore, which are 3 chapters and then you enter the Kolosten arc (up to ch28) and then Elysium Everlasting. This combo of Elysian Realm storyline up to chapter 29 is amazing as well imo, mainly the 3 ER chapters.

yes, issues can be solved in the future over time, but first impressions ruin a game. it’s disappointing wanting to play a game and yet your PC simply cannot run the game when it runs AAA titles with no problem. there are many people who tried to give ww a chance, but the constant lag and server issues just were too much and they dropped the game. 

lag isn’t the only issue, many problems with ui, buildings literally not appearing so it looks like objects floating (https://imgur.com/a/Bv2wwzu), enemy ai literally sometimes stopping in the middle of the fight and completely resetting, and many more which will probably be fixed in the upcoming weeks, but the damage to ww’s reputation has already been done.

other game’s undergo the same scrutiny as ww did, it is not new. genshin is always under fire for plenty of things like rewards and 0 end game content (for now)."

I think PGR has lower weapon pity because of how necessary some sig weapons are, compared to WW where options are more versatile. Right now there's a very limited amount of weapons, there's literally only one 5 star for every type save broadsword which has the banner weapon too. And we already see the system more closely mirroring Genshin with a handful of weapon types, compared to PGR which started pretty much giving each character their own type. So you will have a lot more options as the game goes on, compared to PGR where you either use the default shit 4 star, or the one 5 or 6 star that's available. Plus, not every character's kit requires their sig. Genshin has signature weapons that enhance a character's kit too but probably the majority of players don't have optimal weapons on most of their characters because of gacha, which is generally fine for content. 

Idk about recycling PGR's combat, PGR doesn't really have the dodge -> counterattack; in most cases, it activates matrix which is absent in this game. Dodges and parries aren't really unique to PGR or anything but surely you can agree they're better than not having them, especially compared to the smaller iframe window of Genshin's dodge. It kind of has the core passive system but it feels a lot more simplified and standardized which is welcome imo because remembering how to activate every character's core passive can be a chore as the character list grows."

It doesn't remind me of Genshin one bit, and I don't understand what you mean by ""the UI of the set bonuses""?

And integrating Genshin's elemental reactions system in any game that isn't Genshin is probably impossible. Elemental Gauge Theory is comically complex, and even the slightest error will cause stuff like Xiangling Xingqiu or Fischl who are still not powercrept after 3.5 years because they gave them too much elemental application/no icd.

This is pretty normal.

And Wuthering Waves certainly has a much more unique version than most via it's cost system. In Genshin and most others, you're locked to a set number of slots to use and stats linked to certain slots.

Here? Sure I could run all echoes for 5 set, or I could just use 3 4 cost echoes with main crit rate to full max crit rate as I please. Genshin has no such system. 
Literally the only similarity is ""when you enhance, you can get substats"" which is.... So unbelievably common it doesn't even matter. Hell even in this, in Genshin it auto unlocks at certain levels but here you need some tuning material even after that. It's not similar at all"

Genshin had the good sense to put it later in the game to not overwhelm and annoy players.

That's because Hoyoverse at least knows what works business sense. When they make HI3, Chinese games weren't as positively accepted as they are now so they know trying to push China first would put people off. So they make it appeal to Japan and Western with the main trio being Japanese, Russian and...I'm not sure the nationality of Kiana lol. They only sneak China afterwards with Fu Hua.

After that, they want EVERYONE to know about their game and they know the key to that is Western first. Hence why in GI we go Monstadt the western world first. The same with HSR with Belobog.

Also it helps that Hoyo's story isn't just limited to one regionality. Their central plot and power isn't tied to it. With WuWa, it's clear everything is tied to Chinese. So even if WuWa want to emulate Hoyo on this, they can't because entire lore is around Chinese myth."

I don’t need to know why the broken highway is floating in midair to enjoy running on it and killing mobs. If gameplay elements weren’t an important part of the game then the Hellblade games would be universally hailed as masterpieces. If plot integration was the end all be all (and to be clear there is plot integration with WuWa’s story, it’s just that the plot sucks) no one would be playing Minecraft or competitive online games. Even games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring don’t explain the lore relevance of most of their set pieces. Most players who play those games don’t give a fuck and still have a good time."

Combat is much more character focused rather than elemental combo focused. Boss fights feel a lot closer to full console experiences like Monster Hunter and Elden Ring compared to Genshin’s early bosses that were either really gimmicky or had simple movesets. Bosses in WuWa get expanded movesets at higher levels as well. Echo skills, intro/outro skills, and the fortes make the combat experience feel a lot different compared to Genshin.

When you’re in combat it definitely feels like a new game. I never got into Genshin’s combat system, but I find WuWa’s to be pretty compelling. You don’t always have to reinvent the wheel. HSR doesn’t do anything particularly new in the turn-based genre, in fact it’s entire combat system is basically a simplified version of Trails of Cold Steel III, but it’s still super fun. We also do know that Trail of Cold Steel III inspired the combat system because HSR producer actually interviewed with Nihon Falcom’s president and talked about his love for the series. WuWa doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it offers its own twist on the formula and it does a good job of it."

I skipped pretty much all of WW story except scar and the last two chapters. It was mid, 100%. Some potential but nothing too crazy. Genshin’s story in Mondstat was pretty similar imho. You just chase Venti around for a while then go fight a dragon. I skipped as much of it as I could too - but the one advantage it had over WW is that Venti is a great character whereas Jiyan feels a little flat. 

HSR is my favorite gacha, probably of all time. The story was good right from the start. Space station and Belobog were awesome but Luofu was just terrible. And it dragged on forever. I love HSR but it’s not at all perfect. 

But I mean, this is Hoyoverse we’re talking about. They are the outlier in gacha gaming, but even they have their issues. When you start looking at the other games in the genre it looks a lot more grim. Acting like WW is a disaster or is even bad at all in *this genre* is just peak r/gachagaming."

So even if WuWa want to emulate Hoyo on this, they can't because entire lore is around Chinese myth.

Is this actually confirmed? I thought they were going to add the other 5 Chinese regions Like Jinzhou that were mentioned in 1.x, or at least some of them, like the region expansions in genshin. Surely in 2.0 we get a whole new nation based on a country other than China, right?"

Your puzzles are hapazardly thrown around with no integration into the world or enviornment. There's no giant set piece and awe inspiring moments of exploration. 

The entire thing is ""babies first open world game"" where instead of actually enjoying an open world game people just want to mark shiny thing on their map and run to it.

When your open world is at best a mid tier ubisoft game that get clowned on for their laughable open world design...you didn't make a good open world.

You made a soulless playground that you threw random things into with no care or effort because ""We want to compete with Genshin""."

Their problem is they slapped this combat into a shallow watered down experience that feels soulless and tacked on because they wanted to compete with Genshin for some stupid fucking reason.

But my point is in how much does it change the gameplay itself. Genshin and BotW play differently, you're not switching your character and using skills or ults in the latter. But between WuWa and Genshin, the basics are still the same. You got your skill, you got your ult, and you switch between party members. The reason you switch may have changed from setting up buffs or elemental reactions to using intro/outro skills, but in the end you're still switching. Like you said, it's a twist on the formula, being basically Genshin 1.5. And that might not be enough for some people to ignore the other issues and stick with the game.

As for HSR, the simplicity ironically makes it pretty unique. The reduction in options plus the shared resources does change the decisions you make during gameplay. You have to decide if using your skill on your healer is worth losing the skillpoint that you could have used for damage. In some fights, you have to count your SP 4 moves ahead to make sure you can reapply your buff at the right time. While in most other RPGs, using your skills is just a question if you have enough MP/spell slots/CP etc. on that character. Not groundbreaking, still feel that the difference between Genshin and BotW combat is bigger. But would say that HSR gameplay differs more from other JRPGs than the difference between Genshin and WuWa."

Because of the nature of the release for Persona, the entire game comes out all at once.  You face bosses at a time where the strength of your cast logically makes sense (Yes I know you can break the difficulty of Persona 5 Royal easily, Persona 3 Reload is a better example).  It's always a challenge, yet never too much of a challenge because the difficulty was logically paced out.

For Live Service games, you're basically ""Persona 5 Royal Mementos break the game prefarmed"" permanently.  Sure you get the occasional MoC that'll challenge you, but everything else just turns straight to auto-mode because of how beneath you it gets."

But yeah HSR and GI def have their problems

Which I do think it's more interesting than playing the actual game itself

Because of the way gacha games work, the Story can't be made too difficult for casuals to beat especially those with long dialogues and the story being the center of attraction like in Star Rail. On the other hand, those who play daily will inevitably pass the power level requirement for future story content to the point that everything becomes auto-able.

Star Rail was decently difficult during 1.0 to 1.2 when my teams aren't strong yet. But after playing for 1 year+, nothing in Penacony story challenged my account anymore and I had to intentionally gimp myself so that I don't kill the final boss too quickly.

I don't have a problem with Star Rail's combat personally - you may view it as shallow but unless your account is stacked with money, you can't easily cheese anything in it and you have to think a bit. My problem is that I wish the story lore would reflect the difficulty - Mihoyo imo should really implement a Challenge Mode that makes Story mode enemies into MoC levels of tankyness and hitting hard, but should offer no extra rewards and is only intended for veteran players who wish to elevate their one-time experience (you can only experience the Story once, after all)"
