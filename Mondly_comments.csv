It is the first of a three part investigation into Macron, Biden and Putin respectively. 

The first episode details how Strava, a social network for athletes that tracks GPS location, has been used without oversight by members of Macron's security team. 
Inadvertent public sharing on Strava has allowed the journalists to track Macron's location abroad, guess which hotels he was going to stay at in advance, and even locate his movement patterns in Paris. 

Furthermore, the agents shared personal information like photos with their families, allowing them to be identified in spite of the security protocols surrounding them, opening them up as targets to compromise the president's safety.

These mistakes seem to have been replicated by Biden and Putin's security teams."

This is a extreme example how the lack of awareness re:privacy reveals the information of other people and even puts them in danger.

Take Vladi. He is known to not use modern tech exactly for these reasons. Well, it turns out that his bodyguards haven't been so mindful undermining all their boss efforts. 

The same happens with all of us."

There are devices with privacy/tactical functions, like Garmin Tactix, they are already ubiquitous among armed forces. They (or the respective user accounts) could be altered to completely disable location upload and integration with other online services, and then the organizations could hand them out ot service members free (as part of the uniform) and ban any other type of device and online service. Thus problem can be solved. Anyone with a smart watch either has an approved model or it is confiscated on the spot, put in a Faraday cage to be given back when the owner is on leave. 

Btw Garmin Connect has a granular privacy configuration, while on Strava it's all or nothing. But it does not matter, as long as these companies can produce anonymous ""heat maps"" it should be a strict ""no upload"" policy for all armed forces, does not matter if it's Biden's detail or just the local sheriff or municipial police. It's a liability in both cases."

",Cumulus-Crafts,https://i.redd.it/zgrq1idlkbrd1.png,darrensurrey,"I thought I had the answer (wash body, wash underneath, wax on top because you won't be able to properly wax underneath - if you want to protect the chassis, lift up the car and waxoyl it).

But then I decided to google ""triple foam"" and now I have questions I'd ask the operative:

Tri-foam types

The conditioner/cleaner: Tri-foam works as a soap to help clean the vehicle while typically providing a shine. This product has surfactants similar to those in the other soap products.

The clear coat polish: Tri-foam acts as a wax-type product. It protects the vehicle while causing the water to sheet or bead off the surface. This product uses mineral seal oil, carnauba wax or non-oil based raw material to provide the benefits of a wax-type protectant. For carwashes with reclaim systems, special care should be taken to select the oil-free tri-foam.

Conditioner/cleaner plus tri-foam with additives: These tri-foams have additives such as bug remover or glass cleaner.

Winter formula tri-foam: This tri-foam is made with a non-freeze benefit. The winter formula product allows operators to offer the same look for their top wash in the cold as they do when the weather is above 32 degrees.

So, in fact, I'd just drive off with a dirty car."

You price a cup of coffee at £2 because you think that's how much your customers will pay. But you also think that some customers are willing to pay more, but you don't want to put off the ones who won't pay more. So a splash of oat milk, which costs you fractions of a penny, is 20p, for example. What you're actually doing is saying ""I think I can charge £2.20 for a coffee and people will pay.""

This car wash reckons people will pay up to £19 for a wash, but that most people will only want to pay a fiver."
"Where's the line between the point where the car wash is worth the money, and the point where you're just paying for useless extras? ",Cumulus-Crafts,https://i.redd.it/zgrq1idlkbrd1.png,rwinh,">There's a game with customer choice and having three options. Two isn't enough, Four starts heading into choice paralysis. If there are three price options people take the middle one, so you set up three just for that factor.

It's incredibly similar to the Goldilocks Principle in marketing - too little, too much and just right. Supermarkets were used as an example, with budget, mid-range and luxury product placement and price points. It's been butchered beyond recognition nowadays due to a range of factors (apps and loyalty schemes come to mind). It used to be more aimed towards consumers and their psychological wants and needs.

Today, businesses take these wants and needs, and apply the principle to squeeze more out the middle ""just right"" zone by seemingly adding more for less when the reality is less was not worth it and the more is just a reworded just-right, which is what this car wash is doing based on your analysis.

In theory, the Diamond Wax looks like the favourable option alongside Triple Foam. Some will see the deal in Triple Foam and think that's the standard and go with it, and others will see the £2 extra for wax as an affordable luxury and ""why not"" option. The Eco Wash is interesting as £5 for what you could do at home seems a bit strange but then it's affordable, with Triple Foam being a ""what the heck does that even mean""? option which is cancelled out by the Deal (£5.25 with the app)."

Any polishing that’s worth having will cost you more than £19. If it’s less than £50, just don’t bother. Even there, it’s likely not doing any real ‘polishing’. Save your money… When you say ceramic coating or ‘rain guard’, I assume you mean the cheap spray on, wipe off products rather than an actual ceramic coating sealant or wax. These are just fine, but are very different to a full blown ‘coating’ or proper wax.

You gets what you pays for. Most people won’t mind too much and that’s fine, but you can’t expect the world for £19. My local detailer charges £40 for a maintenance wash - just a wash and dry along with a squirt of top-up protection. It will be actually clean after this, though and no extra damage to the paint!"

However for monitors people really want high refresh rates too, trying to push high refresh rates *and* a high resolution is very taxing on your GPU.

1440p is a nice intermediate between FHD and UHD that gives a better resolution whilst also not being too taxing allowing running at high refresh rates

Most monitors are like 24-27 inches too where at that size and that close to the screen there's not much of a benefit using 4k

So 1440p are very popular for monitors but essentially don't exist for TV's

Someone made a chart a while ago showing the ""optimal"" viewing distances and sizes for each screen size and resolution if I can dig it up. Roughly it's 24 inches for 1080p, 27 inches for 1440p and 32inches+ for 4k

I'm not sure what point you're trying to make really. Obviously cycling isn't perfect all the time, but nor is any transport mode. It's drivers that dominate our street space however, and as a group cause about five deaths a day in the UK.

I don't think we should be encouraging more people to drive, I do think we should be encouraging more people to cycle (and building the infrastructure to make that easier)."

But I'm not here for an argument about the morals of cycling vs driving. Just pointing out how unrealistic that advert is, in the same way you called out car adverts for being unrealistic. 

I've commuted by bicycle in the past, and all the things I mentioned were from experience. I stopped doing it after getting knocked off my bike for the third time by a car. It was simply safer to be the one with a cage around myself before I ended up seriously injured or dead.

You can encourage as many people as you want, but not everyone can use a bicycle. And those will still pose a danger to cyclists. Sadly, there isn't the money or space in this country for effective infrastructure to protect cyclists without banning motor vehicles altogether."

I struggle with recognizing that I'm a good person and worthy of love and something this small is all it takes to help me to feel good about myself. 

Yes, it's mainly selfish reasons that I love and support this app but, it also put humanity into society and for fuck sake, we need as much of that as we can get lately."

That's wonderful,ComfortableScratch80,https://i.redd.it/869wc8wxa91c1.jpg,LindseyIsBored,"I love Be My Eyes! I get a call about once a month. Some of the calls take a long time - I’ve helped a man navigate through a mall to find a store that ended up being closed and I continued to help him navigate to find an alternative store. I’ve also helped a woman sift through an entire bag of beads and color coordinate them. Some calls are short - like helping someone choose the right color sweater. 

Every call has been rewarding. 

It really makes you realize all of the shit that’s in the way of the normal pathway for blind people - tables, trash cans, flower pots, and the small spaces we expect those who can’t see to navigate."

So you might need a cane to get round, but you can read, so you never learned to read braille, so it's harmful if someone starts posting all correspondence to you in braille.

We absolutely SHOULD NOT ASSUME they want or need help. 

People deserve their own autonomy regardless of their health situation and they don't need random folks like you or I presuming in our own heads what they do or don't need.

There is nothing wrong with asking another person if they would like assistance with something - forcing your ""help"" on them is never okay."

Like she might find it easier to get her emails/texts (main source of parent communication now) read through a text to voice app but just the smily face threw her, she might not want to deal with setting aside the time for a phone appointment for this info to be passed on verbally, she might deal fine 99% of the time and simply cba to go through the admin of requesting assistance.

Performance varies with hardware diffs, but there's obviously performance issues that need to be fixed/patched out.

The bigger issue imo is the Story tho. Tbf the beginning story for most Gachas are pretty bland/mid to bad in general, but WW's is exceptionally bad with subpar voice-acting (no offense to the VAs/was directors fault) and long-winded exposition (even for world/character introduction beginning), coupled with Yangyang (unironically competing with Paimon for worst partner 💀). Tbf I heard story potentially picks up with Scar and can obviously get better in future patches, but first impression of story atm is a damn shame. A~~t least in future patches, might be able to skip it at least since Devs mention improving on Skip feature💀~~

Bugs and Initial Story aside, there's still potential with their combat as the fluidity and quick-responsiveness of controls/combos feels good/fun with complexity for rotations. Of course actual combat difficulty isn't particularly hard atm since it's against story content/not invested enough to properly access endgame combat/difficulty, so that's yet to be seen.

Exploration is ehhh since it's def a lot better/faster to explore everywhere thanks to infinite stamina + parkour, but current areas are relatively bland/samey atm. Could just be initial/starting area being relatively basic, but hopefully new areas get more interesting.

Overall WW def deserves to be ridiculed for its poor launch, but it's not dead at launch like others makes it out to be as long as Devs quickly fix the bugs/optimization issues for smoother experience for the gameplay and improve the story and voice-acting to be more impactful/interesting."

For all the complaints Wuwa is getting there’s at least no spyware accusations.

But they fucked it up by making all of Genshin’s bad areas even worse, doing nothing but maybe combat better. But between the awful story and performance most people would never make it to endgame to fully enjoy it. Doesn’t help that they jacked up the rng needed for good gear significantly compared to Genshin thanks to having 2 main stats and 5 sub stats per item."

This is the sort of stuff you're never ever going to see outside of China or with the CC's otherwise since as you say they are absolutely acting as a filter of any legitimate criticism of the game and trying to shut it down entirely wherever possible. Many of whom are the same people always going on about how they never trust a corporation and that they must always be up to no good when you switch a few of the consonants around in the short form name of the company being talked about.  Just absolutely extraordinary levels of bias from the English gacha CC community when it comes to this game.  The Chinese marketing doesn't seem to have done through a middleman group of sponsored CC's in China like it has been in the American market though so everything is just kind of raw and unfiltered and laid bare as ever.

Like the English CC's did not seem to distinguish between the two concepts at all and just seem to figure more hype action stuff happening and FMV's playing during the boss fight climax=better storytelling like English speakers always do with that sort of thing in anime nowadays.

Let's see what else...yeah the game clearly had a worse opening week on the IOS charts then not only Genshin and HSR, but even Tower of Fantasy and recent upstarts like Legend of Mushroom, Solo Leveling and [Dungeon Fighter Origins](https://app.sensortower.com/overview/1529851592?country=CN) (China only), which came out the same day, but I admittedly didn't know it had a colder opening than Reverse:1999 even since I didn't catch that games opening week at the time since admittedly I wasn't that interested.

It'll never not be kind of funny to me that I pretty much always know more about what's actually going on in the otaku/weeb scene both domestically and in Asia than ever of these CC's ever will period, probably till the day I die.   Like these people don't know fucking shit about what they are talking about most of the time or are twisting thing in bad faith on purpose, but pretty often it's the former I can tell.

Personally feeling after finishing the main story quest and general gameplay is that its pretty much average quality of genshin.  The story low parts just matches the likes of kokomi part of the archon quest.  I mean that is pretty bad for a launch but understandable if they rush rewrote the thing since CBT2, and there is a skip button.  I guess the game just is mid enough to hold some attention but not good enough to actually praise without embarrassment.

As for developers listening to players, there is having empathy and giving players what they'd like, and there is malicious compliance that uses feedback as a weapon.  In the case of omnipandering games feedback is almost impossible due to different player bases fighting and radical rhetoric used to ""overpower"" the other side."

Maybe if the community hadn't complained they could have fixed the game's fine details within that time. Just because players were anticipating the game's release they released the game . They even said dev talk they spend more time in QOLs and Echos optimization just because Kuro listened to players feedback. Now if the players are not happy with ww thats their problem not kuro, they r pumping out updates after updates every day knowing that their r problems in the game and acknowledging it and solving it unlike a certain game where nothing of the community is being listened to.
They just need more time to fine tune the game to the player standards cuz apart from animation details, fine tuning of the graphics , game optimization,and story error are dependent on how much time is spent on each of these cases other than that everything is OK.

P.S: i dont know much about their company and how they manage their stuff internally. I have played their game Punishing Gray Raven and i can say that the current game wuthering waves need more time to reach the same level as PGR."

When comparing to Genshin's strengths (exploration, story, and music), Wuwa can't reach that level of quality, and their strong point is combat and movement. Anyone expecting Wuwa to match Genshin's quality was dreaming... Did China feel the same about ToF too?

The story is average (the part where he puts the military's commands in the rover's hands I really think shouldn't exist.)

She stopped playing even before getting to the combat.........

Yes they should’ve worked out bugs before launch and the VA should’ve been shown to even just a group of 10 people for feedback lol, but if you have a halfway decent phone or pc it runs just fine and you wind up just dealing with things like text overflow and switching to a different va (which is what you should do with any gacha game imo)."

Anyway the combat and movements are already enough for me to put this way ahead of Genshin, dunno what CN is smoking."

The combat does look pretty fun so I think it could end up being a solid game eventually, but feels like poor management decisions are hurting it: pushing the game out before it was ready, going cheap on the EN dub/localization, overreacting to critical feedback instead of having confidence in creative decisions (going from one extreme to the other with the story), etc."

Because at Hoyo's level of player base/ scale, 'listening' to players is a dimwit's errand. And far harder to do than scratching their customers unknown itches (like ARPG (Honkai 3rd) and open world (Genshin))

I'll just yap my thoughts here if you don't mind so I don't clog this sub with even more WuWa threads.

For transparency I've explored all the areas (though I haven't done much world quests), unlocked like 80% of the teleporters, and stopped playing before I met Jiyan because I just lost interest at that point.

I tried giving it a fair chance, attempted to read most of the story only to find myself checking out after 3 hours. It was so goddamn tiring to read. The last time I ever felt like this was with Arknights CNY events.

Scar may be one of the first *coherent* NPC that you meet, in the sense that he just doesn't throw jargons at you, but he ended up being pretty ass.

With WuWa's characters in general I just don't feel anything from them man, both characterization and design-wise. I used Rover and Mortefi the entire time because those 2 are the only ones that I liked (and have). I still don't know what Rover's character is supposed to be, the choice you're given are somewhere between playing it safe like Genshin and snappy sarcastic memer like HSR, except most NPC reactions are the same, but then there's that one time you're talking with Scar where you suddenly just spout proverbs to respond to him? Brother what. 

ALSO there's that one time, I forgot when, but basically it just zooms to Rover's face every time you pick a dialogue option and it looked jank as hell, made for a few good laughs but holy fuck.

Combat and the whole pokemon thing was pretty good. Being able to use bosses for attacks/open world transversal was very cool, kinda made me wish the game had a proper mount system instead because I kept spamming the fire bike boss. Chaining your summons with your character combos and character switch attacks was fun and satisfying. These features could honestly carry the game for me, if the game's performance were at least stable.

There are different terrains on the world but most of them felt pretty dull. Couple that with how ass the music is in this game (despite the whole damn thing being based around sound and music???) and it gave me a newfound appreciation for soundtrack and art direction in open world games, both gachas and non-gachas.

I don't see it ever happening, but if they rework the starting experience again I'm honestly down to reinstall and try it all over again. But this is no Cyberpunk or No Man's Sky, or even FFXIV with their 'Blow up the world and start from scratch' solution. There's no 'second try' for a live-service gacha I feel. 

It was an overall 6.5/10 for me... As a beta game. As a full release, yikes."

I always found the combat so interesting: the skills are simple by themselves, but there are many ways to build a team and combine your skills. But they just never gave us anything to really explore the combat potential. Abyss was always just a dps check. Open world was just one shotting trash mobs. ""Difficulty"" came in the form of introducing bosses with long invulnerably phases to eat timers.

This is basically why I'm not even going to bother with wuthering waves, or any genshin clone for that matter. It's why I finally quit genshin too. I really really really enjoy the combat, but I don't see any company trying to make meaningful encounters for the combat. It's not really a gacha game problem; it's something I've seen across gaming in general: the dumbing down of gameplay. Complaining about it gets you the: ""eVeRy GaMe IsN't DaRk SoULs"" kind of response, because wanting any more complexity than nuking the screen suddenly means you want dark souls."

I have a rather good PC (Ryzen 2700X, RTX 3090), and didn't really have any performance problems. I encountered some bugs, but nothing game-breaking for me. But well, it's obvious that for many, performance is a real issue right now.

The story is really pretty meh. The appearance of a certain character in Act III makes you think that it is going to get more interesting, but then, the story plays out exactly as boringly as before.

Exploration is also kinda whatever. There are some nice parts, but mostly, it feels like Genshin, but mediocre. There is also at least one puzzle that is also just straight-up a Star Rail ripoff.

So yeah... it's ok. In most cases, people are better off playing Genshin since it does most things better than WuWa, but if you don't like Genshin or are taking a break from Genshin, it's fun enough for a while."

I think wuwa's plot is significantly worse, but its combat is significantly better. Genshin had slightly better music, Wuwa has much better traversal, which makes the exploration much less boring and much more interesting.

My favorite content in both games so far has been the character sidestories where you hang out with the gacha characters. Although Wuwa doesn't have a lot of those yet, Genshin didn't really have a lot of them either on launch. They only released a bunch of them years into the game's cycle, after the devs realized they were popular.

I haven't experienced optimization issues outside of Epic launcher being the worst, but my PC is quite overtuned for these games so I do believe that it exists.

---

Anyways, the reason I got burned out of Genshin was because the combat was super simple and got super boring and repetitive. Doing a fight once was fine but doing the same fight 500 times to farm artifacts got super boring and tiresome.

Wuwa is definitely much higher skill ceiling and fast paced, I can see myself playing this game for longer. We'll see how it all shakes out. I'm hoping the plot of Wuwa gets less cringe in the next chapter, and optimization issues get fixed, and then it might actually be a good game."

It is better than genshin in some ways, worse in others, and it is not as polished for sure. It blows every gacha not made by hoyo out of the water, and with some polish it will be the first serious competitor to genshin. I believe this is why there is so much negativity about it right now, because it's the first gacha to come out with the potential to compete with genshin.

Even some CCs have noticed some odd follower behavior popping up in their channels, which seems like there is some astroturfing going on.

As to whether or not it will come close to Hoyo to make them be worried, likely not. While hardcores love to claim how it is the gameplay that matters the most and how new competitors that has better gameplay would completely destroy Genshin, that is just not true. Most Genshin players, the silent majority play the game for everything else. So Hoyo knows that even if they lose in the combat aspect, people would still go and stick with them for the story and everything else.

Just look at their revenue. Consistently strong despite the lack of endgame for hardcores.

Plus, what people don't realize is that even if WuWa might be able to come close, their method isn't something to be aped as it is a terrible practice. Mismanagement of everything that lead to rushed product and bad first impression. Hoyo could just simply said, ""don't be like Kuro who listened to players too much that they killed their own vision.

It was like why are you asking me dude?, you’re the goddamn General. Then I just chose wrong answers to see, yep he would repeat until you picked the right answer. I knew it was suppose to be front line lines, but I said split up and flank.

I had no idea what they were doing that last act, it picked up in intensity but it felt foreign in some way. No attachment onto why the motivations of some characters shifted within 3 acts.

Also hilarious the lion dancing dude being on the top of the tower dancing in the cinematic preparing for war, it was so off, felt like lampooning the goddamn genre. Or the guy we might earn in a week or two via the Tower, that dude shows up in the cutscene like we know this mofo, like “Hew in the blue fuck are you? Michael Jackson Moonwalker Gacha is that way ==>”

Holy shit I just had an epiphany, if the devs made WuWa into a Genshin Clone parody by going off the walls meme territory by using every trope possible, I seriously would buy into that premise. Just go ham doing absurdity and make fun of doing the most basic shit. I know it will not happen but the way CN is acting they have dug themselves a hole not easy to get out of.

They could give us the next 10 limited banners free, and it wouldn’t appease this backlash. The snowball effect has started going downhill and has reached a huge boulder size that Kuro games is not ready to get hit with the impact.

But the way the trailblazer was treated made sense in the context of the story.  While I thought it was pretty stupid how everyone treated him/her with such familiarity despite barely having any screentime with them, the way the trailblazer fit in to the story at least *made sense*.  To a fault, almost, they were basically a background character the whole time.

And in recent patches Genshin has nailed the Traveler's role in things.  While they are big players in the story, they're always shown as spectators who play their part when needed and never the central piece to any of the stories.  Inazuma was always all about Raiden and the way she dealt with her grief (Though execution was a bit lacking), Sumeru was always all about Nahida and her imprisonment despite her best intentions, Fontaine was always all about Furina and her lonely struggle for a prophecy that she doesn't even know is true.  Traveler was part of these stories, yes, but they were never the main attraction.

I don't even know what to say about the Rover.  It just comes off as really dumb Mary Sue power fantasy."

The only thing they committed to was lore/world building which while nice is really not very motivating as a driving thing to gamble on gatcha. Role-playing super fans are in heaven with genshin, people who want a gatcha action rpg may have found something better in wuthering now. Genshin copied the gatcha genre but introduced a new formula that has others copying it, namely having more than a turn based card game attached to a slot machine. 

You won't find a genshin-like game without steep farming and time sinks. What would keep people playing while waiting for slowly developed content? 

You are simply playing the wrong genre if you 1. Don't like having to wait for energy refills and 2. Maybe not getting the character you want without spending money/being extremely conservative with free currency. I also throw in the inclusion of RNG as hell farming and tedious resource gathering/daily refreshes to just be what you get for gatcha games.

Would abyss floor 13 or Samurai warriors be good enough endgame? Instead they rolled out several events and got feedback to create this new endgame mode. It is an end game mode focused on elemental reactions which is the core of its combat system.

I enjoyed the combat in WW but the random stuttering on my PC detracts from it yet I am able to play small scale BDO node wars in remastered mode with 120 fps.

However, I play on mobile alot and it crashes often on my s22 yet I am able to run PGR just fine on it. I hope Kuro resolves these issues quickly."

That means they have a very talented developer team, an insane management staff and most importantly, a lot of money to keep up with the cost. Kuro, or other companies have to better or on par with Mihoyo in these requirements if they want to compete and ""dethrone"" Genshin.


But what i said is big ""if"" WW was getting the same opportunity as Genshin. But in reality it is not. The opportunity for Mihoyo was what Chinese idiom called ""the harmony between heaven, earth and human"". In one hand, we have a pandemic once a century event, everyone stay home and want something to kill time and distract themselves from the fact that people is dying left and right while their future is uncertain. The chip shortage make many people want to play game but don't have good PC, console to play them and resort to mobile games. Stimulus package of government in many countries mean people, especially the ones with bad financial management want to spend. In other hand, Mihoyo bet big on a high quality open world gacha game, a thing that not guaranteed success, especially when they release it simultaneously on all regions( CN, JP, KR, GLOBAL). That would increase a lot of operating costs and paperwork, law etc.., while they don't know how the Global (western audience) would love an anime style game( especially from China with current geopolitical tensions),despite they need to tap into the boarder audience, the ones that sweaty hardcore gatekeeper called ""normies"" because they are huge, the more people play the game> more people pay> more revenue to keep up with the live service development cost. Another gamble is they developed the game from 2017 but with the graphics in mind that the game would be for the 2020 devices, if it doesn't play out and genshin made same problems like WW did today, maybe Genshin would flop.


But well, Cai Haoyu and Da wei bet big and they won big, the game release smoothly and successful, even more than what they imagined. And with that big stream of money come in, they change the development direction of the game to be bigger, more ambitious ( just look at the first two regions compared to inazuma, then sumeru and fontine, the scale and quality is much better, and now they're cooking natlan). It's a clear example of ""don't sleep on victory"". That can achieved because they are private, the founders of Mihoyo is the one that made decisions, they are good friends and very enthusiastic about their jobs. The thing maybe different in public companies that decisions in hand of shareholders, and they only care about money.


Talk back about WW. WW don't get the same opportunity like Genshin did. The pandemic is gone and everything becomes normal. Since 2020 till now many things happened, wars, geopolitics tensions make economy recessed, especially in China which is the biggest market, where the decoupling of western companies make many Chinese people lose job hence less spending. That's not to mention the biggest factor is they're not the first stepper anymore but is competing against the well established giants that's Genshin, which already had a wellworked development pipeline, loyal playerbase and especially, Mihoyo have a big pocket they can spend. 


What i said in those three paragraphs is what Kuro and WW would face even  if things go smoothly, however, their release is much worse than i thought, to the point it's like a crash. The game is rushed, clearly not ready to release yet. Now they have to bear a big burden of fix the problems but at the same time developing new contents, but the revenue is much lower than they thought. Can they do these things is hard to know but the future is pretty grim, especially with how much we see over at CN server"

It should be released some months later to fix bugs and optimization.

I do agree that at core it's a solid game that can be entertaining, especially the combat, however, I do think the root cause is still trying to one up a game but with only a shallow understanding of why it was successful, and lacking a core concept that makes the game ""its own thing"", and at least half of the problems they are currently facing originates from being built on those sloppy fundations."

A lot of its issues can be boiled down to ""not meeting expectations"", whether in plot or optimization, which means that the game will be better recieved once they tackle those.

It's not out of the ordinary to have a terrible first patch. Star Rail was abysmal to play during 1.1 - 1.3, Genshin had an unimpressive first arc in Monstadt, and so on. What matters is how they'll recover from those, and I bet WuWa can ball."

On the one hand, running up walls is cool, on the other hand, it devalues the terrain and the journey.

In Genshin, climbing up Liyue's highest mountain is one of my favorite gaming moments in the last few years, also because of the godly music (personally, I think Genshin's music is MILES better than WuWa's), because it looked fantastic and heavenly, and because it felt like an formidable obstacle that you slowly overcome. I love going up mountains in real life, and I loved it in Genshin as well. So when instead of having that experience, you just run up the mountain, the mountain just isn't anything special anymore."

So you figured they would be against things that would decrease gambling. And then Hoyo became stingy with their pulls and then suddenly everyone is ok with the chance to gamble.

What's even more ironic is that this is something that a lot of Genshin players realized during the first anniversary fiasco. During that time, everyone want more pull, but when they began to attack outsiders and innocents, I made them rethink ""are we seriously doing all this and reduce the game and more importantly, ourselves to just pulls?"" So most of the players after that didn't care about the pulls so much anymore. You can see 2nd and 3rd anniversary where a repeat of the fiasco was attempted and it didn't happen.

Meanwhile, those that didn't share this mentality are willing to ignore everything and reduce their game to just pulls. Nothing else matters to them."

Release a CBT 2 which is pretty much a different game still with issues and then we end that CBT fix half of them and then gaslight everyone else about problems with the game.

We proceed to fix nothing and then publish that buggy game. In the following weeks we will be giving out free pulls and promises that we’ll “do better” while just hiring and firing more people behind the scenes and getting some freelance fiverr devs to begin work on the next region.

Which also means no one will give the new game a chance, and thus no revenue will be built to then improve the game, meaning only genshin will ever be playable. And since it’ll have a monopoly, they’ll continue to ignore their players and give out piss poor rewards and compensation.  

That being said, wuwa itself is pretty much dead in the water at this point with all the drama. CN and JP, the largest regions, are done with the game. And tbf, Kuro deserves this big L at this point as they keep screwing up. Between leaking emails, bugs, the story, the English va, the echo xp and tuner situation, etc… well people have had enough.

Once Natlan comes out, it's curtains for me and Waves. I don't even hate the latter here.

I tried to get into WW and went into it mostly blind (to the point I was unaware of all the discourse between it and genshin's fanbase up 'til launch), but this is just painful. From the disastrously poor English VA direction and unremarkable OST to a plot that is all over the place and crammed with jargon, I actually feel like throwing in the towel even after a few hours. 

The combat is great and the game runs fine on my PC (granted I'm on a beefier rig with a 4090), but nothing particularly blew me away in this game. I'm all for a Genshin alternative, but Waves is going to have to do better than this."

It is not told in a particularly novel or compelling way.

1.0 -1.2 in Genshin were very mid, mostly focusing on story updates, although 1.2. added Dragonspine, After that **there was no new region for almost an entirely year.** They added the summer islands in 1.6 which was a very small area, then Inazuma finally came out. That means that for the first 9 months of the game, the updates were very small. It was so bad that players had complained about Lantern Rite and Hoyo actually had to respond to their complaints, and 1.4 is notorious as the worst patch in the game's history **until recently.** They almost always go at least 2 patches in a row with no content; Genshin is notorious for filler patches, and the quality of the last few updates has declined greatly. Lantern Rite was a great update, but the next 2 updates after that were exceptionally mid, with 2 updates adding only one character each (not even a 4\*) and Chiori's patch being infamous as the worst in the game's history now, with no content, and a character who released who underperformed greatly.

The next patch is also a filler patch with only story updates and the new game mode Hoyo is adding **to incentivize rolling more, and to further shill the recent banner characters.**

At the end of the day, all Hoyo cares about is money. Their developers are not as passionate as you pretend they are, they often ignore their fans and like most other games are run by corporate greed. But the main point of what I'm saying is that Hoyo tends to have very, very dry months in Genshin that allow them to prepare for new areas, it's like x.0\~x.3 are usually the best patches of a new region, then every patch after that is waiting for the next one.

And the quality of the events in Genshin is very bad. The alchemy event (again, Chiori's banner) has to be one of the laziest in Genshin in a long time, but there are also other events from last year like Freminet's event which is a glorified hangout/character quest (he has no hangout), etc. 

I'm not saying any of this to dunk on Hoyo or complain, but I just wanted to play devil's advocate a bit because Hoyo is definitely not a magical, fun-loving company that keeps pace with a sadistic release schedule. They know exactly what they are doing and now have 3 years of practice, the first year of genshin was a travesty when it came to quality updates."

The old Lingyang tracks down a boss he's sworn to kill. Yang Yang and Rover is tasked with helping him. From the start Lingyang makes it clear to Rover that he neither trusts nor respects them and questions their combat ability.   
 
The three gets to the boss, *the boss Lingyang sworn to defeat*, and Lingyang asks us, *the person who he just expressed his distrust in*, to fight the boss with Yang Yang while he clears out the mobs.  
 
We fight the boss, there's an epic battle at the end of which this cutscene plays. The boss and Rover clashes and separates as both are knocked back. Lingyang charges in from nowhere, and then one shots the gravely weakened boss, kill stealing it. Yang yang goes, ""wow what great timing! We couldn't have done this without you! You are amazing for doing this"".    
   
The little shit even asks you, ""did I really land the last hit?"" and then goes on about how he finally defeated his sworn enemy but why does he feel so empty? (No shit, we did all the hard work). At no point does he thank you or acknowledge your effort in this. Then after the dialogue ends you can talk to him again, and he has the nerve to say ""why are you still here?""."

I played Star Rail since launch at it was really good back then as well and was generally praised highly by everyone to be one of the best gacha game launches ever.

Also, to fix the WuWa story problems, they will basically need to replace the entire beginning of the game, which will be rough. If later story parts are better written, it only solves half the problem, because every new player will need to go through the bad parts first. And the difference is that in WuWa, the current first story chapters are just really uninteresting, even below the ""meh"" level."

Star Rail was abysmal to play during 1.1 - 1.3, Genshin had an unimpressive first arc in Monstadt, and so on. What matters is how they'll recover from those, and I bet WuWa can ball.

The problem is you aren't competing against HSR and Genshin in 1.0-1.3. You're competing with them _right now_. Sure you can't compete in quantity no one can expect that reasonably, but you should be competing in quality. 

The entire core selling point of ""An open world!"" is unoriginal and bad _because of being unoriginal_ because it feels like it shouldn't be there. It's a tacked on shallow experience solely because they wanted to compete with Genshin instead of actually taking their good combat system and doing something with it. They decided to make an uninspired boring world to explore and designing it for the Genshin hater crowd who thinks ""I dont like exploring why do they want me to play the game"". So exploring was watered down to nothing so people could just move on. 

Unoriginal doesn't always mean bad, but unoriginal = bad when you're being unoriginal solely to try and siphon an audience with such blatant direct copying."

is this how WW players cope now, by rewriting history? Genshin and HSR on launch were smooth, or at least decent to play on almost all devices they were advertised to be able to run, and that's why they caught on quick. They don't have gamebreaking bugs that players can't open the game lol. And while the opening arc of both GI and HSR as a whole was nothing to write home about, it managed to hook players by being simple and straight to the point, plus great music that just lives rent free in players' head. WW did none of that, the opening arc is complicated with lots of terms for no reason (it could unironically use a Paimon here), and the music is just forgettable, which sucks because Kuro can make bangers from PGR"

That's just you. Please don't use your personal experience as representative of many or trying to rewrite history just to make WuWa look good. Genshin's story at launch did not have much problem at all and majority like it. 

Heck due to the story, it's impact was huge to players till today. It is considered to be the favourite region, which is why it tend to be priority in receiving special events such as the Golden Archipelago, which also many considered to be one of the best event.

Man playing Genshin after WuWa made me appreciate just how much detail given to the character by the dev and thier insight to it. The sound and the visual gives weight to it. 

The sound when character in Genshin does their skill makes it clear that you are doing something special. The visual also is distinguishably. With WuWa, a lot of the skill seems no different than normal attacks really. I'm was doing normal attacks then press skill and I went ""wait, that it?"" I mean their flame effects is nearly unnoticeable too in overworld.

Didn't help that the font size for the numbers are small so giving the idea that you are dealing pittance of a damage which actually is as a lot of combat would be you chipping at enemy's health. Genshin however put huge font size to tell you ""THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU DEAL! BE PUMPED!"""

I love hoyo and gacha games, I defend hoyo and fgo for their amazing games but I won't ever defend the predatory system of gacha. It's still something that turns you into an addict. Which is why I have great respect for players who make no wish accounts, mostly dain savers in genshin and Diamond savers in HSR or for any other character in general. I recently made a no wish account to save for a su expy in HSR and I realized it's so hard to control that addiction of pulling. At first it doesn't get you much. But as you see characters you like and want behind a banner that's gacha and requires you to farm thousands of primos/jades or just easily spend 1000 dollars to get, the system really draws you in and tempts you to spend money to get the characters you want.

 And that's when the companies which own such games start giving out freebies to keep the players from quitting the game, which in turn earns more players. The rewards are for people who are really into the game and to keep them from quitting. That's what wuwa is doing now. They give out free pulls and a standard 5 star selector and they know the players will keep playing for the rewards. Then they recently nerfed the standard dps, especially calcharo, who many guides advised to get and many players picked and even spent money for. It's a pretty shady yet neat strategy if you think about it. First, give away a 5 star selector which makes players stay, then nerf those characters. Which then makes the player force to pull other units to make them better. And guess who's banner is next? Yinlin. The unit calcharo synergieses well with. That's why giving rewards is not and should never be a metric for judging a game. No matter how much rewards they give out, if the game is terrible, then know they're just doing that to keep you in the game."

But recently they release S ranks back to back and you need all of them because they cover different area (Sena for lightning, Thelema for Ice, and Lantern is fire I guess since she hasn't been released in GLB). All Part 1 is in a grey zone of obsolesence because newer bosses cater part 2 gameplay but we still have Part 1 bosses that cater the latest Part 1 character.

If you asked about pvp aspect yes it still there, we even have a new pvp for the endgame players"

After the change of writers in chapter 20 something (part 1), I feel bored with the pseudoscience talk, it's just too much to me. No focus on character interactions, just on made up science stuff. But I'm really attached to the game, so I won't drop it soon.



Also, nope ,part 2 isn't really more f2p friendly, it was an illusion. At the same time they have farmable stigmata (memories from PGR but you only need 3), there are four S-ranks back to back already, breaking the usual alternated pattern of S rank, A rank the game used to have. You literally have to pull every patch if you want every character (before that it was possible to get all of the new ones with free gems, and a lot of weapons with the $5 monthly pack)."

The conversion from USD to my currency is what hampers me from spending on a game due to fluctuations.

This is I would say, one of many flaws of Kuro. They really have terrible insight of the future. Even if there would be some profit down due to the services of currency exchange, Hoyo knows that if they make it easy for players, they are more likely to spend. So they convert the currency to a player's and they make it easy to buy the monthly.

Kuro did the opposite with PGR during launched. They didn't convert and did not give the option to buy the monthly outright but instead have to do currency exchange.

And then they make it so that even the second lowest money package (lowest is 1dollar, the second is 4 or 5 dollar) is not enough to buy the monthly. You basically have to buy both 1 dollar and 4 dollar. People complained about this. So you know what Kuro did? Instead of reducing the monthly price so that it will be exact 4 dollar, they make two monthly. One is the unchanged price and one is the reduced price. I've never seen monthly difference before lol. Usually it's on the duration.

And of course they don't seem to convert the currency to local again with WuWa. With PGR I can understand because they are ""small time company,"" but this one? Yeah no.

Mind you that even other games are able to do this. Action Taimanin of all games are able to automatically convert their price so that I know exactly how much I'm paying."

You referencing the CURRENT mihoyo financial state when he is talking about Mihoyo BEFOFE genshin success, and when they only have HI3 and GGZ money to make genshin is really showing you don't know what you talking about.

Having her hand on the holster? I could EASILY see that from what is effectively a military Police officer on patrol finding someone very out of place.

On the other hand, the current story is ridiculous in how over-trusting the two are on meeting you, it's VERY much falling into the common Xianxia range of ""everyone is your simp, or everyone is your enemy"" writing, and it's just BAD writing both ways. There are fragments of good, the background worldbuilding itself is fine, outside of the unnecessary usage of ""new"" worldbuilding tech-terminology being *hammered into your skull* too fast when the plot hasn't had a chance to take hold FIRST, And I like how much the MC actually has to say when the..well ""supporting cast"" isn't present and overriding our own thoughts and making us choose-non answers to REALLY stupid questions. 

It's a bad sign when you WANT Paimon around to act as the idiot-ball carrier that needs to learn everything even though she's supposed to be the world guide.

And it makes sense. Most here know Mondstadt now so I don't need to go into details, but the traveler arriving there is just a foreign traveler coming into this peaceful region. The people there being welcoming in general is fine for the setting.

WuWa starting area tries to portray a fortified city on the border with an active war going on right in front of the city. Yangyang is basically Amber, both being outriders.

Yeah this has been my main concern regarding WuWa’s long term financial success. It already had its work massively cut out for it. 4.7 looking like a very meaty patch with a highly anticipated character, HSR still in its yearly hype period with a ridiculously anticipated Firefly (who also seems pretty whale-baity like Acheron), and ZZZ coming out a bit over a month later, a game that will inevitably steal the spotlight just on the basis of being a Hoyo game. Hell, that’s not even counting non-gacha releases like a little niche game called Elden Ring. Then Natlan comes out in 3 months and I genuinely do not think WuWa will stand a chance unless they literally just give everyone like 3 free 5 stars that month.

It had to compete with all of this, so this rough launch and negative CN reception is the LAST thing they need right now. I really don’t think the devs are having fun right now."

I'd put money on it! World and greater cosmology Background lore completed? Absolutely. Major cast members from all of the intended destinations made before the game ever released? I'd say close to 95% of the characters released so far were already created before launch, but not finalized til shortly before their release in the story. I'd say even the intended ending of the entirety of the Teyvat saga, and the Khaenri'ah/Dainsleif subplot is mostly written out already, even if the multiple Archon chapters to get there aren't even on paper yet.

But written? Not a damn chance, considering what we got for the Inazuma archon arc. What they've written falls within the lore, but that could not have been written in advance, or Inazuma would have been a COMPLETELY different story after the first chapter, without the dozen plot-holes and loose ends they left behind there, the shoddy character development, the whiplash pacing, and the absolute lack of empathetic character development for what SHOULD have been an important character death due to a major reveal about the Delusions."

This is my biggest issue with the game honestly. The technobabble is annoying, but it's not insurmountable and it's not unique at all to WW. Shit, even MHY fumbled the absolute fuck out of HI3's climax with stupid exposition dumps and the less said about Arknights' obtuseness, the better, for two examples.

But jesus WW even pretty much copy/pasted like 90% of Genshin's UI and menus. Character progression is virtually identical. They even copied the annoying shit from Genshin like having to go to one specific area to synthesize materials. Which is extra annoying since MHY realized that was a pointless annoyance when they got rid of it for HSR entirely and let you combine materials anywhere, even directly from the character upgrade menu. It's like they spent 100% of their brain power on making up as much technobabble as possible and 0% on trying to make the game its own thing. The actual combat gameplay and character designs are going to buy a couple of months for the game for me, but even being as optimistic as possible, I doubt I'm still playing it by the end of the year unless the endgame combat is on a different level. I already have PGR for that anyway I guess."

WoW was challenged for more than a decade by dozens of clones that attempted to do exactly what they did except worse.  This is exactly the same reason why the ""You can't compare 4.0 Genshin to 1.0 WW"" argument falls flat.  

A game offering competes in the current market, not in the past, and if you are offering a clone game to the market, you are always to going to be behind.  The first mover dominant competitor isn't just going to stop progressing once you enter the ring, and as a result you are always going to behind the curve.

Inevitably this results in players asking themselves, ""why would I play the bootleg copy when I can play the legitimate one?""  

While FFXIV ARR (2.0) was more successful than its 1.0, back then it was still far from being a rival to WoW because it was literally a WoW clone.  We know from the documentary that they ripped all of the concepts from WoW Cata.  They were even bleeding players during HW post patch because Alexander was too hard and casuals had no content. XIV only started challenging WoW for the top spot when they realized that they should be focusing on those casual players that make up 90%+ of the market instead of fighting for WoW over the 10% of hardcore raiders.

Thinking that you can compete 1:1 with the market leader while having significantly less resources and experience is sheer hubris."

Weapon banner being better isn't what you think it is. If you've played pgr, you'll know that signature weapons matter quite a bit lol sure you're guaranteed the weapon, but the weapon is also a lot more necessary. That's the trade off. Better system but the monkey paw is that the signature is much more necessary now. One step forward two steps backwards. 


This is especially true for WuWa right now because the alternative options are all incredibly mediocre. 


As for the combat, that's subjective. I play a lot of devil may cry so whenever I try these flashy ""fast paced"" mobile games, none of them ever really click for me cause they all just feel incredibly shallow by comparison to what I'm used to. 


the combat is just pgr but they took out the orb system. So they couldn't even really make a new combat system for their new game and had to just recycle PGR's? At the very least Hoyo made GI and Hi3 extremely different types of combat systems.

So you have some open worlds to do and several stuff from story. I honestly love the story up to chapter 25, mainly the domination arc (chapters 23-25 iirc). After that, you enter the Elysian Realm lore, which are 3 chapters and then you enter the Kolosten arc (up to ch28) and then Elysium Everlasting. This combo of Elysian Realm storyline up to chapter 29 is amazing as well imo, mainly the 3 ER chapters.

yes, issues can be solved in the future over time, but first impressions ruin a game. it’s disappointing wanting to play a game and yet your PC simply cannot run the game when it runs AAA titles with no problem. there are many people who tried to give ww a chance, but the constant lag and server issues just were too much and they dropped the game. 

lag isn’t the only issue, many problems with ui, buildings literally not appearing so it looks like objects floating (https://imgur.com/a/Bv2wwzu), enemy ai literally sometimes stopping in the middle of the fight and completely resetting, and many more which will probably be fixed in the upcoming weeks, but the damage to ww’s reputation has already been done.

other game’s undergo the same scrutiny as ww did, it is not new. genshin is always under fire for plenty of things like rewards and 0 end game content (for now)."

I think PGR has lower weapon pity because of how necessary some sig weapons are, compared to WW where options are more versatile. Right now there's a very limited amount of weapons, there's literally only one 5 star for every type save broadsword which has the banner weapon too. And we already see the system more closely mirroring Genshin with a handful of weapon types, compared to PGR which started pretty much giving each character their own type. So you will have a lot more options as the game goes on, compared to PGR where you either use the default shit 4 star, or the one 5 or 6 star that's available. Plus, not every character's kit requires their sig. Genshin has signature weapons that enhance a character's kit too but probably the majority of players don't have optimal weapons on most of their characters because of gacha, which is generally fine for content. 

Idk about recycling PGR's combat, PGR doesn't really have the dodge -> counterattack; in most cases, it activates matrix which is absent in this game. Dodges and parries aren't really unique to PGR or anything but surely you can agree they're better than not having them, especially compared to the smaller iframe window of Genshin's dodge. It kind of has the core passive system but it feels a lot more simplified and standardized which is welcome imo because remembering how to activate every character's core passive can be a chore as the character list grows."

It doesn't remind me of Genshin one bit, and I don't understand what you mean by ""the UI of the set bonuses""?

And integrating Genshin's elemental reactions system in any game that isn't Genshin is probably impossible. Elemental Gauge Theory is comically complex, and even the slightest error will cause stuff like Xiangling Xingqiu or Fischl who are still not powercrept after 3.5 years because they gave them too much elemental application/no icd.

This is pretty normal.

And Wuthering Waves certainly has a much more unique version than most via it's cost system. In Genshin and most others, you're locked to a set number of slots to use and stats linked to certain slots.

Here? Sure I could run all echoes for 5 set, or I could just use 3 4 cost echoes with main crit rate to full max crit rate as I please. Genshin has no such system. 
Literally the only similarity is ""when you enhance, you can get substats"" which is.... So unbelievably common it doesn't even matter. Hell even in this, in Genshin it auto unlocks at certain levels but here you need some tuning material even after that. It's not similar at all"

Genshin had the good sense to put it later in the game to not overwhelm and annoy players.

That's because Hoyoverse at least knows what works business sense. When they make HI3, Chinese games weren't as positively accepted as they are now so they know trying to push China first would put people off. So they make it appeal to Japan and Western with the main trio being Japanese, Russian and...I'm not sure the nationality of Kiana lol. They only sneak China afterwards with Fu Hua.

After that, they want EVERYONE to know about their game and they know the key to that is Western first. Hence why in GI we go Monstadt the western world first. The same with HSR with Belobog.

Also it helps that Hoyo's story isn't just limited to one regionality. Their central plot and power isn't tied to it. With WuWa, it's clear everything is tied to Chinese. So even if WuWa want to emulate Hoyo on this, they can't because entire lore is around Chinese myth."

I don’t need to know why the broken highway is floating in midair to enjoy running on it and killing mobs. If gameplay elements weren’t an important part of the game then the Hellblade games would be universally hailed as masterpieces. If plot integration was the end all be all (and to be clear there is plot integration with WuWa’s story, it’s just that the plot sucks) no one would be playing Minecraft or competitive online games. Even games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring don’t explain the lore relevance of most of their set pieces. Most players who play those games don’t give a fuck and still have a good time."

Combat is much more character focused rather than elemental combo focused. Boss fights feel a lot closer to full console experiences like Monster Hunter and Elden Ring compared to Genshin’s early bosses that were either really gimmicky or had simple movesets. Bosses in WuWa get expanded movesets at higher levels as well. Echo skills, intro/outro skills, and the fortes make the combat experience feel a lot different compared to Genshin.

When you’re in combat it definitely feels like a new game. I never got into Genshin’s combat system, but I find WuWa’s to be pretty compelling. You don’t always have to reinvent the wheel. HSR doesn’t do anything particularly new in the turn-based genre, in fact it’s entire combat system is basically a simplified version of Trails of Cold Steel III, but it’s still super fun. We also do know that Trail of Cold Steel III inspired the combat system because HSR producer actually interviewed with Nihon Falcom’s president and talked about his love for the series. WuWa doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it offers its own twist on the formula and it does a good job of it."

I skipped pretty much all of WW story except scar and the last two chapters. It was mid, 100%. Some potential but nothing too crazy. Genshin’s story in Mondstat was pretty similar imho. You just chase Venti around for a while then go fight a dragon. I skipped as much of it as I could too - but the one advantage it had over WW is that Venti is a great character whereas Jiyan feels a little flat. 

HSR is my favorite gacha, probably of all time. The story was good right from the start. Space station and Belobog were awesome but Luofu was just terrible. And it dragged on forever. I love HSR but it’s not at all perfect. 

But I mean, this is Hoyoverse we’re talking about. They are the outlier in gacha gaming, but even they have their issues. When you start looking at the other games in the genre it looks a lot more grim. Acting like WW is a disaster or is even bad at all in *this genre* is just peak r/gachagaming."

So even if WuWa want to emulate Hoyo on this, they can't because entire lore is around Chinese myth.

Is this actually confirmed? I thought they were going to add the other 5 Chinese regions Like Jinzhou that were mentioned in 1.x, or at least some of them, like the region expansions in genshin. Surely in 2.0 we get a whole new nation based on a country other than China, right?"

The entire thing is ""babies first open world game"" where instead of actually enjoying an open world game people just want to mark shiny thing on their map and run to it.

When your open world is at best a mid tier ubisoft game that get clowned on for their laughable open world design...you didn't make a good open world.

You made a soulless playground that you threw random things into with no care or effort because ""We want to compete with Genshin""."

Their problem is they slapped this combat into a shallow watered down experience that feels soulless and tacked on because they wanted to compete with Genshin for some stupid fucking reason.

But my point is in how much does it change the gameplay itself. Genshin and BotW play differently, you're not switching your character and using skills or ults in the latter. But between WuWa and Genshin, the basics are still the same. You got your skill, you got your ult, and you switch between party members. The reason you switch may have changed from setting up buffs or elemental reactions to using intro/outro skills, but in the end you're still switching. Like you said, it's a twist on the formula, being basically Genshin 1.5. And that might not be enough for some people to ignore the other issues and stick with the game.

As for HSR, the simplicity ironically makes it pretty unique. The reduction in options plus the shared resources does change the decisions you make during gameplay. You have to decide if using your skill on your healer is worth losing the skillpoint that you could have used for damage. In some fights, you have to count your SP 4 moves ahead to make sure you can reapply your buff at the right time. While in most other RPGs, using your skills is just a question if you have enough MP/spell slots/CP etc. on that character. Not groundbreaking, still feel that the difference between Genshin and BotW combat is bigger. But would say that HSR gameplay differs more from other JRPGs than the difference between Genshin and WuWa."

Because of the nature of the release for Persona, the entire game comes out all at once.  You face bosses at a time where the strength of your cast logically makes sense (Yes I know you can break the difficulty of Persona 5 Royal easily, Persona 3 Reload is a better example).  It's always a challenge, yet never too much of a challenge because the difficulty was logically paced out.

For Live Service games, you're basically ""Persona 5 Royal Mementos break the game prefarmed"" permanently.  Sure you get the occasional MoC that'll challenge you, but everything else just turns straight to auto-mode because of how beneath you it gets."

But yeah HSR and GI def have their problems

Which I do think it's more interesting than playing the actual game itself

Because of the way gacha games work, the Story can't be made too difficult for casuals to beat especially those with long dialogues and the story being the center of attraction like in Star Rail. On the other hand, those who play daily will inevitably pass the power level requirement for future story content to the point that everything becomes auto-able.

Star Rail was decently difficult during 1.0 to 1.2 when my teams aren't strong yet. But after playing for 1 year+, nothing in Penacony story challenged my account anymore and I had to intentionally gimp myself so that I don't kill the final boss too quickly.

I don't have a problem with Star Rail's combat personally - you may view it as shallow but unless your account is stacked with money, you can't easily cheese anything in it and you have to think a bit. My problem is that I wish the story lore would reflect the difficulty - Mihoyo imo should really implement a Challenge Mode that makes Story mode enemies into MoC levels of tankyness and hitting hard, but should offer no extra rewards and is only intended for veteran players who wish to elevate their one-time experience (you can only experience the Story once, after all)"

Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22,OSRSkarma,https://i.redd.it/81m4ue5uy21e1.jpeg,Witty_Ticket_4101,"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 📉 The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎢 High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎯 Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ❄️ Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: 🔒 Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: 🚀 Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: 📦 Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: 🍔 Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: 👖 Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ⚠️ If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: 💡 Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ☃️ Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: 🌪️ Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

\- Nvidia has been having issues with their racks that they order from SMCI among others. Nvidia has asked rack supplies to change this on multiple occassions.

\- SMCI is one of the rack providers but has been dealing with a lot of stuff on their own, such as severe audits and delistings. They escaped delisting but their reputation has been severely damaged.

\- Dell could step up to the plate because they have been sitting on the sidelines of this whole a.i. hype train for a while but since a few month ago have stepped up their rack creating division.

\- Nvidia might mention Dell as another main supplier of the racks after being asked about SMCI. The overheating topic will make or break this earnings call and Dell might be the solution to both Nvidia and the overall a.i. hype train

\- Dell have their on earnings on 26th of November, this might be the second catalyst for the Dell stock

If Target is having problems, hard to imagine that the crowd at Bath & Body works is booming.

In fact I was there a couple weeks ago when they had their major sale on all soap, every soap in the store was like $3.50 or something. Last year for each category they sold and had this sale, it was shoulder to shoulder in the store.

This time, there was like 3 people, and the cashier said it had been dead all afternoon/evening.

Many of you may recall the guy who was tracking people in BBWI stores around New Jersey or whatever it was last year - I played along as well because of how packed the stores were from my experience.

I'm holding 50 $28 11/29 puts and 25 $33 11/29 puts. They seem to have had a huge drop in foot traffic vs last year and I suspect most customers are the same Target shoppers who didn't turn out."

On top of that they have a cash cow revenue stream from their local county who's been increasing taxes on citizens for more infrastructure work, and wrapping up their multi billion dollar projects. So I suspect they'll be hitting a higher than expected revenue for the year.

In the search box type AECOM also sort all years to see the multiple contracts they have ""active.""

Also why? 105c Dec"

Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22,OSRSkarma,https://i.redd.it/81m4ue5uy21e1.jpeg,davewuff,"""which company has the biggest potential to move to the up or downside""

# ChatGPT said:

Among the companies reporting earnings tomorrow, **Elastic (ESTC)** and **Intuit (INTU)** appear to have significant potential for stock movement.

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Analysts expect notable volatility due to its high-growth profile and focus on AI-driven enterprise software. Its performance depends on cloud adoption trends and margin improvements​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** Intuit's results could be pivotal given its substantial institutional ownership (83%) and recent concerns over insider stock sales. Its flagship products (e.g., TurboTax) are highly sensitive to guidance revisions​.

Both companies are in sectors with growth drivers but face differing risks, making them likely candidates for big price reactions post-earnings.

""in which direction""

# ChatGPT said:

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Likely **upside potential** if it beats expectations for revenue growth and cloud adoption, as it has historically responded positively to strong results. However, high valuations could magnify downside if it misses guidance​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** Mixed sentiment. Strong results in its small business and AI offerings could push it **up**, but recent insider sales and sector-wide competitive pressures suggest possible **downside risk**​.

Markets currently favor **Elastic** for upside and are cautious on **Intuit**.

""how big of a positive move do you think is possible given all the information available to you""

# ChatGPT said:

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Potential for a **10-15% upside**, as growth stocks in the software sector often react strongly to earnings beats, particularly if revenue growth or margins exceed expectations. Recent AI-driven product developments could amplify optimism​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** A **5-10% positive move** is plausible if its small business ecosystem and AI tools outperform expectations. However, its high market cap may limit extreme upside unless guidance surprises significantly

Ok I guess..."

Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22,OSRSkarma,https://i.redd.it/81m4ue5uy21e1.jpeg,Uisce-beatha,"I mean, it's only up 60% so far this year and another 10% would be pretty crazy for a stock that never moved like that before. Not even a year since the 3:1 split and it's pretty much halfway back to the pre split price.

I think the realization of how dumb the next four years are going to be started to sink in before the weekend and tariffs are going to absolutely crush WMT's profit since they rely on cheaply made foreign goods. The US does not have the manufacturing capability to produce these goods and even if we did it would be much more expensive and it would be a couple of years before they could even get those items off an assembly line.

I could be incredibly wrong but I'm willing to pick up a few 11/22 $78 puts to see.

The problem with holding til December to see if it goes higher it’s the gains being burned by theta. Remember Walmart is not known for being volatile, when you see gains you sell and then start again with a farthest date, doing the snowball effect with the gains. 

If you’re taking long calls, you should sell when u see at least +100% gains and then roll position. I've been doing this since Walmart was at $50~ and it worked for me. 

You can always buy shares as hedge, Walmart is very promising and decent."

Best is to sell ATM calls to open on those calls. Or technically CCs. That way you collect you original premium, plus more from volatility, then when you get a pullback, you throw that new money down on some new OTM options, OR you buy back those options. Or you buy much further out LEAPS so that you have a larger time factor. Many MANY options strategies available when you use options. This would require at least options level 3."

I've average down over the years and now I'm finally up in the green.  Still going to hold through earnings as well as vying 10k more shares depending on open price"
Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22,OSRSkarma,https://i.redd.it/81m4ue5uy21e1.jpeg,Legitimate-Ant-3089,"They have suffered a terrible run of bad luck, since they ipo. They were up for the chance at a contract to produce ev trucks for ups about 4 years ago they had the stock hyped up. When they were eventually beat out by bigger competitors they started an continuous decline ultimately leading to a reverse split earlier in the year to get their price over a dollar.  They are a target of shorts and other people praying on their downfall.  They were never supposed to start securing contracts, sales, and traction.

Well this quarter has  had announcements every few weeks about sales and contracts so I know they will do better than historically.  I also know that a lot of sales last quarter had to be deferred to this quarter.  Which made their previous quarters financial report look insanely bad. I'm talking they were expected like 3m in revenue and they reported 800k. It was BAD. But like I said those  reports could not capture sales they DID make that quarter.  This drove the price even LOWER. 

They have a market cap of less than 40 million bucks, they had a 1 for 20 reverse split so they are LOW float. They ahave decent to high short interest. 

Also, trump and Vance are historically supportive of this company and they are American made.

All they need is 1 positive ER be ause NOBODY expects it.

The conditions for this to literally start a parabolic run are perfect. They just need ONE good report, and they are going to get it this time. I'm betting TOo MUCH on it. But I know it will pay off. 

This is not a community hype move, Workhorse has been a banned topic in WSB since 2020, so most people have forgotten they exist.

This will be a move that people post gains on and the rest of the sub goes ""why didn't you guys say something before it blew up.


This is BEFORE it blows up.









And then of course, if they do have a bad er.  You need to sell immediately because the stock will absolutely crater back to almost nothing. So don't expect a bounce back. It either shoots up on a good er, or you NEED to cut your losses. DO NOT EXPECT bad earnings to ""dip"" the stock. It will go -50 to -70% on open if the er is bad.  So do shares. You will get ripped off on options unless they hit."

Not all of WMT's groceries come from the US and as to what degree it's really hard to even know. I know they say 2/3 of all their groceries are from the US but WMT is notorious for lying to promote their image. I don't think they are going to have a bad earnings and I think they will beat across the board. 

What I'm looking for here is a revised future earnings to the downside in anticipation of the tariff war and turbulence of the uncertainty the new cabinet nominations bring to the US and her trading partners. With the mood of the current market a weaker future earnings guidance could be all it takes. Shaving 5%-10% off the stock's price would still put it up 50% on the year."

You’re simply paying 3X the value of bitcoin versus just investing directly in bitcoin.  But they’re buying the bitcoin with debt.

"BEWARE! Mondly, ""the app of the year"", doesn't let you cancel their subscription in-app!!!",lucaspottersky,https://i.redd.it/og9964mprpr81.png,WineOutOfNowhere,"Having cancelled, I’d say it’s actually worse than just “no cancellation in-app”. There’s no indication anywhere how to cancel. No notice, no link on the main site when accessed via desktop. It’s a known problem. I think I had to go google my own bank statement to figure out who owned billing for mondly. 

This in the addition to it just not being very worthwhile imo despite it being one of the only out there with Bangla. I did however find the spoken cadence accurate, in that the Bangla pronunciation was polite while the Hebrew full on shouted at you lol.

ETA: I actually did have apple at the time and still wasn’t able to cancel via the store app for those claiming this is somehow excusable. I may have purchased on desktop? It’s been a couple years at least."
"BEWARE! Mondly, ""the app of the year"", doesn't let you cancel their subscription in-app!!!",lucaspottersky,https://i.redd.it/og9964mprpr81.png,Isimagen,"I am not surprised at all. I got a ""lifetime"" sub of Mondly for next to nothing several years ago. I bought it with that code and used it for a while.

I will say the interface is okay, it looks nice, and the fact it uses real voices is a plus.

But, other than that, it's absolutely horrible. There are tons of mistakes in the Swedish course. I've reported them for years, occasionally going back to see if they correct them. Nope. They never correct them.

Some examples: Occasionally they'll have something like (made up example here) ""She asked him to iron her shirt."" While the actual voice is saying ""He asked her to iron the shirt."" 

They'll give you a verb for something like ""to make"" and then use other verbs that mean the same thing. But when you click the conjugation chart above the text, it's the wrong verb.

The real voices are great but they seem to have them banked and use them by stringing together. So for instance the voice actor said 10000 words clearly. They then put them together. But in many languages the order of words can change the pronunciation. So they blow that.

Lastly, in Swedish, they have one giant mistake. The word ""De"" (they) is pronounced like ""dom."" They get this wrong 99% of the time and use it like ""day."" They get it correct in a few where the whole sentence is said as recorded by the actor. 

Anyway, stay away from this app. It's full of mistakes and they have no desire to fix them. And that's not even talking about tricky billing practices like OP mentioned."
"BEWARE! Mondly, ""the app of the year"", doesn't let you cancel their subscription in-app!!!",lucaspottersky,https://i.redd.it/og9964mprpr81.png,,You can cancel through your subscription section in the App Store. But yes it doesn’t allow for in app cancellation.  Not only that but it shows all the prices it offers for the same service. This is for iPhone however. But the subscription is the same even when I use it on my desktop. Hope this helps.  I wish I knew how to add photos.

I am Ioana from Mondly. I wanted to chime in a bit here as we'd like to clarify how the billing system for Mondly works since it appears that there's a misunderstanding.  
  
Like many other apps and products, we work with secure payment providers to offer our services. Depending on where one purchases an app or subscription, they can only cancel it through the same provider through which the initial purchase was made. This goes for the majority of online purchases, not just the ones for Mondly.  
  
Subscriptions purchased through Google Play Store, App Store, or 2Checkout can be canceled through the respective payment processor as they were the ones processing the actual payments. This information is included in the emails confirming the purchases.  
  
However, we'll make sure to take this as a learning opportunity and include these explanations in our future emails so it can be clearer for everybody.  
  
Kindest regards from the Mondly Team to all Redditors passionate about language learning!"

Otherwise, similar limits and critiques as duolingo I suppose. 

I have two books I’m using, each of which comes with limitations, errors, and in some places weird hints of colonialism. And differentiating between dialects? Forget about it. My husband is a native speaker but is better for conversation practice than teaching—which he is terrible at bless him."

It had a good story and everything but it just doesn't feel deserving of an Action RPG title anymore. The combat in Spiral Abyss is just not engaging and with the upcoming Imaginarium Theatre it seems like its spiral abyss but with more restriction.

It's pretty much a doll house game at this point, just collecting characters and cute character poses is where it's heading. I've played it for 3 years, its safe to say Genshin will not evolve anymore.

Waiting for ZZZ, hopefully the devs working on the game actually knows how to make a fun and engaging endgame content unlike Genshin.

I said what I said, Genshin is a doll house game."

Most Genshin casual players are happy with just pulling for a pretty character and immersing themselves on the story. Which is why I said its a dollhouse game. And with the new 4.7 character poses reward as the main selling point of Imaginarium Theatre they can now play dolls with cute poses.

WuWa itself is also dollhouse game so perhaps we're all sissies. But clearly Genshin's focus isnt so much endgame/combat based as it hasn't innovated on Spiral Abyss for 3 years. That is why I called it stale.

And the new 4.7 endgame content was just disappointing and I genuinely think WuWa's combat system is breath of fresh air as   the parry, dodge/counter mechanic, swap tech, and blink has made combat exhilarating. I'm not trying to say that I'm better than casuals, I just really find WuWa's combat more engaging.

I personally think Genshin could design a better endgame mode, but they always make it in a way that is so restrictive and is not their entire focus. The dollhouse and cute poses comment was a mishap on my part cause I didn't mean it as insult but I really think Genshin is a dollhouse game catered to casual who want their characters to do cute poses which is literally what 4.7 will bring."

It's unbearable how little you know and think so highly of the element system of Genshin thinking it makes a good action RPG game.

WuWa has more higher skill ceiling interms of combat, swap technique in WuWa literally allows you to play 3 characters at once on the field where as Genshin is literally locked with playing one character on the field.

WuWa combat system is miles ahead better than Genshin and more engaging. The most tech Genshin had was HuTao jump/dash skip and it's literally pathetic.

Combat wise Genshin is very subpar and unengaging, the element system was a good basis but they never really pushed it further.

Genshin is pretty much a story game at this point while WuWa is a legit action RPG.

Honestly I don't mind collecting cute camera poses in Genshin once in awhile. Theres not much to it than just that, Spiral Abyss never changed for so long and I highly doubt Imaginarium Theatre would change anything that would make combat more exciting compared to Wuthering Waves."

If you mean the time needed to get all mileage to pity one character I think its 2 months. The good thing is the pity accumulates in the mileage store until you decide in which character to waste it.

>It's really not surprising as it's fun for outsiders and the Genshin fans have held it for months.

Held it for months?

My brother in christ i can give you a whole collection of shit genshin players have been saying to ww's videos and to its players before ww released

Genshin copy this, no identity that,

We literally are still getting 'world looks dead compared to genshin'

A full on dumbass with negative braincell count started comment on fucking rock formations in WW to shit on it and say genshin did it better, rock formations fucking ROCK FORMATIONS IN A VIDEO GAME

Were you guys blind to that or in your minds genshin community can only remain as a victim? Even now some asshole made fucking bots to shit on WW on brax's stream

NAH BUT THINK OF THE HARMLESS CHEERFUL GENSHIN PLAYERS WHO GOT HURT BY THOSE BASTARDS AT KURO'S COMMUNITY FOR MONTHS!!!! Gotta push the agenda that genshin players are victims

Oh and to put it into prespective

'Genshin could never' the whole line WAS FUCKING STARTED BY HSR, aka another hoyo community, yeah even HSR doesnt like genshin community and i m starting to really underatand why, cause they really are this insufferable, pick fights with other community, then shit on them saying they got shit on first and are the victims here"

We're excited to announce that Wuthering Waves has achieved the No.1 spot for downloads on the Top Charts in over 100 regions! We appreciate all of your support!,Adventurous-Fox-5248,https://i.redd.it/p54a6yzmmy2d1.jpeg,MichiruMatsushima,"Not sure what are you hoping for, all the data is already available and WW currently has a low RpD (revenue per download), with the estimated total revenue being around 7 000 000 USD at this moment: https://appmagic.rocks/iphone/wuthering-waves/6475033368 (it can only show > 5 or > 10, but since > 5 has only appeared yesterday, 7 000 000 USD seems like a solid estimate for this exact moment).

Anyway, this game with its largely higher RpD in the East https://appmagic.rocks/google-play/solo-leveling-arise/com.netmarble.sololv will likely take the spotlight this month as a (not) very unexpected new arrival.

There's also ""Top Apps"" ranking where you can see WW being #1 downloaded during this week... but its revenue spot hangs around #14 - 15, which is disappointingly low: https://appmagic.rocks/top-charts/apps?aggregation=week&date=2024-05-26

EDIT:

A Japanese tracker https://game-i.daa.jp/?APP/6475033368 shows WW with 1.63億G (as of May 27th), and that's about $1 000 000 (1億G = 100 000 000 JPY). Given that Japan corresponds to 17% of total payments in accordance with the 1st website, an estimate of $6 000 000 - 7 000 000 in total seems to be correct. The question is, will it go much higher and will the people start paying more? In my opinion, not on this banner. Red haired girl is where they'll start earning some 'real' money, probably.

If we compare this to Genshin's release... https://www.pcgamer.com/grossing-over-dollar100m-genshin-impact-recoups-development-costs-in-two-weeks/ Let's just say that **right now** WW is nowhere near its level of success."

But I kinda dig new endgame in genshin(plus a lot of people I have seen too like Imaginarium theatre). WuWa has more stylish combat, but at the end of the day for me endgame it’s not really different than genshin. One is basically spiral abyss and the other is one of the HI3 endgame. So I think WuWas combat is more stylish for me, but I kinda find more originality in genshins combat than other gachas(most of them are either turn based or DMC style hack and slash games which is not inherently bad but kinda overused.) Genshin combat is kinda different. But that is just I believe a preference thing 

As for genshin making better endgame…I believe they can. But they don’t need to. Because 70-80% of people playing gacha games are casuals so genshin appeals more to that audience. The fact that they even decided to add is nothing short of miracle(probably because 20% hardcore players were asking it for 4 years)."

Sure there's one optional mode where the bosses are harder but that's probably just a gear check anyway. I know u can swap cancel out of some of those long ass clunky animations, sure I guess that's extra ""tech"" but I wouldn't say it's fun or needed to do that. Just think ppl are way over praising the combat. Sure it's the one thing that's a bit different than genshin and u can do some extra stuff but it doesn't look as good and it's not as fluid so I would never consider it better combat. Future characters could fix that maybe."

I have 3 other gacha games (AFKJ, HSR, Re1999) which I can auto farm and blow my daily stamina on and gain premium currency within 15 mins each. Plus I actually play other full-priced games. And a job to fund all this.

I genuinely do not have the time of day to grind boss fights every day for mats and echoes and exploration for the currency. But hey at least now all the full-time streamers have enough content for their 8+ hour job."

I believe competition will honestly drive both games forward. And WuWa has been such a god send for me personally, it's fucking insane. The worst WuWa can do to Genshin is literally remove 50/50 on the weapon banner as the weapon banner in WuWa is 100% guaranteed. I think it's a win for Genshin players if that happens."

I mean theres ways around the long animation moves anyways by either swapping out, shielding, dodging, or parrying. Just saying it's not needed is disingenuous, why would you perform a risky long animation attack and expect not to get punished for not paying attention as ""clunky"" that is just brain dead.

Micro managing combos for more damaging combos or controlling aggro is fun and engaging. It seems like fun to you means not getting punished for performing a risky long animation attack with no consequences cause I agree it requires thinking and could be exhausting for some of you.

Then why do you make it into an issue even? First, How about just appreciating the fact that you have the *option* to endlessly farm echos *if you want* instead of either having no content at all or being locked behind stamina for it or x amount of keys/entries which literally makes it into a fomo kinda thing every day and leaves this bad aftertaste that is much worse, especially when you don't have the time every day but then you feel like you are forced to finish at least that given daily amount every day. And now imagine that given daily amount really does take you 2-4h and you have no choice, you either do it or lose your precious daily refill of stamina or keys or whatever. In wuwa, using up your stamina takes less than 10min which is gonna be the most crucial part for the more important character materials. 

Once you have your characters and talents maxed, I bet you'll be fine with even just 'decent' echos. But at least you have the option to farm them whenever and how much you like, but you never have to force the game when you don't want to and get this fomo feeling of missing out if you aren't putting in 5h into farming.

That type of shit is what you have to fear in gachas if you have limited time, not wuwas optional endless echo farming which is whatever.. you play for yourself, no rankings nothing, it's a you issue, because you think if you don't farm that endless content you fall behind, maybe even behind other players, but why shoud you care why do you play a gacha/games, for your own fun, no?! you don't have to stress it, it's another long term, casual genshin game)"

He didn't have that issue, it wasn't particularly common, but it *was* happening to me and it kind of soured the experience. Hell, I've had no issues with wuwa but my sis has had both blurriness + stuttering issues.

One day I wanted to play a mobile game that I'll invest in longterm, so I installed Nikke for shits and giggles, but got bored pretty fast. Couple of days later I saw that one Motivational Alpha video of PGR. Tried it out, and have been playing the game since.

So naturally I started snooping around on reddit looking for discussion about this game.

And that's when this sub confused me: everywhere else I looked up PGR, people loved the game. The community praised the game (duh), other game's communities praised the game, I loved the game.

Yet every post about PGR I saw on this sub had full comment sections being either passive-agressive, or full on hateful towards the game. So I just stopped looking here.

But now with wuwa release I couldn't resist and visited this sub again.

Idk what it is with this sub and hating on Kuro, and I'm not defending WuWa, because yes, the game did release in a very bad state, but the way some people treat it like literal malware that should be uninstalled baffles me, because the game does look cool, and the gameplay is fun. (And that's coming from someone who has played actual mechanically sophisticated videogames their whole life and can see through ""fake"" gameplay loops in no time)

But if I compare it to Botw, I think I can understand where you are coming from.

Wuwa's exploration is very monotone. It doesn't lead you to some culmination.

In Botw for example you can be exploring, and eventually you'll stray on top of some mountain and find some cool shit like a shiny unicorn, or a boss, or a hidden quest.

With wuwa meanwhile you are basically consistently doing the same thing. The only instance of ""coolness"" I've encountered yet was that Vergil chair easteregg.

I will say though, traversing does feel nice (whenever you don't get stuck under a rock), but here I'm also biased because it resembles MH Rise's movement, which grew on me after 300 hours in that game."

Nobody's blaming anyone for enjoying WuWa when not everyone can, it's when they know there's a problem but just shrug it off because they're part of the fortunate few that can enjoy it. What's expected for them to do is to be vocal with the problems as well instead of living in this fantasy land of WuWa can do no wrong. 

Comparing this to a real world analogy, it's when rich people say that life is easy when the majority of people in society are poor and unfortunate. Sure, you can enjoy life as a rich man but don't start crying once you realise that people won't care about your demise like what happened to the titanic submarine incident a while back. People don't care about the fortunate, they'll even be infuriated if the rich flaunt their life to them so it's like a kick in the dick for some people to see others praising the game to high heaven when they can't even open it. Praise, but you should also criticize kuro for their subpar release at the same time."

Other than that: getting the best weapons and pets that suit an specific character is harder than pulling characters. Getting them to max rank (limit break) its also hard without spending on gacha. Notice I said ""hard"",  not ""impossible"". You can farm them up until 1 limit break below max at most without dupes, and you can get 5 stars weapons and pets as well. The thing is that those take significantly longer to get and will never be maxed without dupes, so you need to prioritize if you want to fully gear X character over Y.  
The point overall is: do you feel the need of reaching the top 10 in the game which obliterates bosses, something only possible with a fully maxed and geared  character, with everything uncaped through dupes to get fun? Or are you content with playing It normally and fighting bosses instead of oneshoting them? Kinda like Genshin. 

I may be wrong in a couple things tho, It has been a while since last I played."

I agree that resin can be altered. Right now it stands in this peculiar juxtaposition of attempting to be casual friendly yet only really being best for people who have time to drop on using the resin. However seeing as hoy changes the resin at this point to be a 24 hour 1 login a day shift i feel in future they’d be willing to eventually shift more towards the HSR model to encourage casual play. Especially because the upcoming endgame will need more resin to get characters into shape for it.

Genshin has some upcoming hud changes for dialogue even adding a log button which opens up the door to potentially get a skip button since dialogue will be re-readable. Also we’ll be getting a hideUi button so thats based."

I've always known about Genshin. A lot of people I know played that game. I think I've always been on the edge of trying it out, but the thing that was just barely tipping the scale in the wrong direction for me was that everyone has always told me that Genshin combat is pretty easy. I value complexity and skill expression in videogames, so ended up never giving that game a chance. Plus it being a gacha made me judge it even more harshly.

The only gacha game that genuinely made me interested in its gameplay was none other than PGR, so I stuck with it. I genuinely adore everything about that game, because it made me, an ex League crackhead, a Dark Souls dick rider and a vivid gacha hater, care for a freaking gacha game.

So I will admit that I came into WuWa as a complete Kuro shill, and I'm willing to give them more slack than I should. But if... IF! Kuro manages to make something unique and satisfying out of WuWa, like they did with PGR, to me it will all be worth it.

But right now I agree, the games are very very similar and there isn't a lot of incentive to play it over GI, especially when you want to lean more into the casual gameplay and story of these kinds of games."

Atleast the main story was. Was especially disappointed about how they did >!Dan Heng's character and his previous life!< and how they use new words out of nowhere, expecting us to understand wtf they mean.

But after Luofu, in Penacony, I have to agree. The game set a FAR higher bar in terms of character designs, character writing, worldbuilding, plot progression, map designs and actually interesting overworld gameplay. They've been on a roll with Penacony so far. My only complaint would be how incredibly long-winded the dialogue can get sometimes, making everything feel even more longer and exhausting."

La réponse est sans appel: non. 150 balles littéralement jeté par la fenêtre. Comme un investissement, j’accepte ma perte. Mais, vraiment, si vous hésitez, n’achetez pas d’abonnement Finary.

Mon retour d’expérience est 100% aligné avec OP. Interface lente, UX confuse et dans les choux, support client aux abonnés absents, intégrations avec les banques et autres contrats d’assurance extrêmement limités (en particulier si comme moi choix avez des comptes à l’étranger). L’outil d’analyse en lui même est super limité, lent, mal foutu, apporte très peu de réponses et ne permet pas de le customiser pour répondre à nos propres questions.

L’outil « d’analyse et de suivi de patrimoine » est absolument pas leur focus et leur application crie « maintenant que vous êtes là, confiez nous vos cryptos, achetez notre assurance vie (dont on répète à longueur de vidéo que ça ne sert à rien pour la majorité des gens) ou confiez nous vos sous en gestion privée (dont on répète à longueur de vidéos que c’est vraiment un mauvais choix) ».

Bossant dans la tech j’y vois l’archétype des founders inexpérimentés qui vont dans tous les sens, se font influencer par leur VC et n’ont au fond soit aucune vision, soit font l’inverse de ce qu’ils disent (spoiler: ça fini toujours mal).

Je suis content qu'ils proposent un produit pour le suivi de patrimoine, c'est fou que les produits actuels soient tous battus par Excel.

Incroyable la validation que reçoit OP.

Je ne suis pas particulièrement fan de Finary, mais de là à qualifier l'application d'arnaque et son fondateur de gourou simplement parce qu'on trouve que le service ne nous convient pas, c'est un peu fort.

Affirmer que les utilisateurs satisfaits de Finary sont juste des moutons idiots qui se font plumer est une exagération énorme, surtout quand on regarde le nombre de véritables arnaqueurs dans l'écosystème de la finance personnelle.

Concernant l'application, l'incompatibilité avec de nombreuses banques m'a refroidi, et c'est pourquoi je ne suis pas client. Mais ce problème n'est pas forcément imputable à Finary. Les banques, en effet, ne jouent pas le jeu de l'Open Banking malgré la DSP2.

Revenons à ces accusations de « gourou » et d'« arnaque » : peut-on vraiment faire pire en termes d'exagération ? Finary propose un service avec une promesse claire. Rien n'empêche de l'essayer ou non. Où est l'arnaque ? Il y a une période d'essai de 14 jours pour tester et se désabonner sans frais !

Ce genre de critique est typique des cercles d'experts. Tout le monde valide OP en répétant que Finary est une arnaque et que ses utilisateurs sont des moutons, sans jamais proposer de solution aussi pratique. Gérer tout cela dans un fichier Excel ? Soyons sérieux.

La chaîne YouTube de Finary vise à sensibiliser des débutants, des personnes qui ne s'intéressaient pas auparavant à la gestion de leurs finances personnelles. L'application cible aussi ceux qui n'ont pas envie de perdre du temps avec des exports de données et leur intégration dans des tableaux Excel.

Finary, c'est cher, et ses graphiques Sankey ne servent à rien ? Très bien, mais combien de temps OP consacre-t-il à gérer son fichier Excel, et en tire-t-il réellement plus de fonctionnalités que celles proposées par Finary ?

Il serait intéressant qu'OP partage un modèle de son fichier Excel et sa stratégie de suivi pour qu'on puisse comparer.

Oui, c'est possible de gérer par un fichier Excel, mais ça n'est pas l'approche de simplification des applications comme Finary. Leur stratégie est d'augmenter la base de clientèle en faisant la promotion de la finance personnelle aux néophytes. Ces néophytes devenant plus expérimentés avec le temps sauront dire s'ils préfèrent y passer plus de temps avec une gestion plus complexe ou garder Finary."

J'ai pas de doute qu'au début leur intention d'ouvrir les yeux des gens sur la finance personnelle était véritable, mais depuis de l'eau a coulé sous les ponts et leur business model a changé. Aujourd'hui ils me donnent l'impression que tous les moyens sont bons pour faire de l'argent. Ils ont eu un démarrage très mou au lancement du projet, ça végétait dur, et puis ils ont commencé à faire des vidéos d'analyse de patrimoine et ça a fait exploser leur chaîne youtube. C'est des vidéos faciles à faire, qui font des clics facilement. Le fondateur y répète toujours la même chose, c'est complètement inintéressant à part pour un débutant complet. Pour rajouter de la valeur ajoutée ils ont invité des gens de pas mal d'horizons différents (les finary talk). Des Marc Fiorentino, des Nicolas Chéron, des Mathias Baccino, etc. Pas forcément des gens très compétents ou très recommandables, il y a des histoires de pression/intimidation qui sont sorties sur internet dès lors qu'on remet leur compétence en question. Finalement il semble 1/ que les questions posées aux invités par le fondateur ne soient pas rédigées par lui donc le débat est assez limité dès lors que le sujet devient complexe et ça a pour conséquence que l'invité peut dire ce qu'il veut car il n'y a pas de contradicteur en face de lui. 2/ forcément, conséquence du premier point, que les personnes invitées ne viennent ici que pour faire la promotion de leur crémerie (un livre qui sort, gérant de smallcaps qui veut vendre son fonds, gérant de SCPI qui veut vendre sa SCPI, VRP de trade republic qui veut faire ouvrir des comptes bancaires, etc) et ça se voit vachement. Pourtant il y a des tas de gens compétents sur des sujets de pointe, des chercheurs ou spécialistes d'un sujet qui n'ont pas de produit à vendre, mais étrangement on ne les voit jamais sur Finary ces gens-là. En plus de ça le discours de Finary, à force de vouloir manger à tous les râteliers, devient illisible : après avoir poussé des années avec une croisade contre les assurances-vie et autres produits aux frais prohibitifs, maintenant ils ont fait un partenariat pour proposer leur propre AV. Ils ont même mis en place une fausse liste d'attente pour souscrire à leur AV et générer un sentiment premium. Commercialement c'est du génie, sur le reste... Maintenant ils ont sorti leur livre sur l'investissement, ils proposent l'achat de crypto. Et ça va continuer. Bref, commercialement le fondateur est fort, c'est un mec intelligent, aucun doute. Mais j'ai de la peine pour les gens qui suivent cette chaîne youtube sans s'informer ailleurs en la prenant pour la vérité générale. Leur service d'abonnement mensuel Finary Plus, comme l'a souligné l'auteur de ce sujet, est médiocre. Pour 0€ annuel j'utilise Portfolio performance et c'est beaucoup mieux que leurs outils pour gérer la bourse. Après, leur business model est de dire que tout est dispo au même endroit quand on utilise Finary Plus, mais est-ce que c'est indispensable pour autant, j'en doute. Finary bénéficient surtout d'un trou dans le marché, avec une grosse absence de concurrence sur le secteur, et ils ont très bien compris comment occuper ce vide. De manière générale Finary ne sont pas les pires, il y a largement pire sur les réseaux sociaux (vendeurs de formations qui promettent monts et merveilles en premier lieu), mais très clairement je crois que je ne comprendrai jamais les gens qui suivent aveuglement ce genre de chaîne sans chercher à comprendre leur mode de fonctionnement. A mon avis Finary pensent de moins en moins à l'intérêt de leur audience à mesure qu'ils deviennent de plus en plus riches, et de plus en plus à se faire de l'argent sur son dos, mais ce n'est que mon avis. Ce qui est certain, c'est que le fondateur finira très riche."

Disclaimer : ma vision pour Finary est de devenir une plateforme permettant de suivre son patrimoine, gérer son budget, investir son argent et s’éduquer. Cela prend du temps. Il faut jongler entre le produit, la régulation, le marketing, etc. Nous n’en sommes qu’au début de l’aventure, et c’est un pari complexe. Beaucoup d’autres entreprises se sont cassé les dents dessus. Nous sommes en passe de réussir, notamment grâce à des éléments que tu critiques (comme l’abonnement). Je travaille non-stop depuis 5 ans pour y arriver. Tout n’est pas parfait, et je suis preneur de TOUS vos rapports de bugs afin d’améliorer la plateforme. Vous pouvez me les envoyer en message privé ici, sur X ou IG.

• **Culte de ma personnalité** : l’argent est une question de confiance. Une banque comme la Société Générale existe depuis Napoléon III. Pourtant, quasi aucun client de la SG ne connaît le nom du PDG. Finary a été créée en 2020 ; personne ne nous connaissait à l’époque. Nous avons décidé de nous montrer pour instaurer de la confiance et prendre le contre-pied des banques. C’est un choix compliqué, car je suis quelqu’un d’introverti. Il se trouve que notre chaîne YouTube croît incroyablement vite, et je me suis retrouvé sous les projecteurs. Nous réalisons actuellement 5 millions de vues par mois sur YouTube. Je suis très fier de savoir qu’énormément de néophytes prennent leur patrimoine en main grâce à mes vidéos. Qu’ils utilisent Finary ou non, ce n’est pas le sujet. Le feedback sur la sur-présence de bannières s’entend, nous allons ajuster.

• **Capital social** : nous nous sommes posé la question de savoir si nous pouvions “bootstrap” une société avec la vision de Finary. Notre conclusion : c’est quasi impossible. Nous avons donc levé une quinzaine de millions de dollars. Notre structure de tête étant américaine (obligatoire pour participer à Y Combinator, dont est issu Reddit), nous recapitalisons régulièrement la société opérationnelle en France. Toute l’activité et les emplois sont en France. Inutile de préciser que le capital levé ne nous rend pas riches. En réalité, ces moyens sont dérisoires pour réaliser notre vision. À titre de comparaison, la Société Générale a injecté plus de 1 milliard d’euros dans Boursorama depuis la prise de contrôle partielle en 2002."

J’ai eu le malheur de demander sur le forum s’il y avait une alternative, parce que fournir ses identifiants bancaires c’est quand même très grossier comme solution, et je me suis fait descendre comme quoi il fallait que je fasse confiance, que je n’y connaissais rien (je suis dev pourtant et j’ai bossé des années en cyber) et que j’étais globalement un idiot.

J’apprécie d’avoir un outil qui me permet d’agréger tout mon patrimoine de façon synchronisée (y’a eu des bugs mais aujourd’hui ça tourne bien). Avant je le faisais à la main, ça prenait du temps, et ce temps, il vaut largement 125€/an. 

Je n’utilise pas la gestion du budget, c’est quelque chose que je fais à la main depuis 25 ans, et je vais pas changer maintenant ^^. (Et aller checker 3-4 comptes bancaires c’est rapide).

L’analyse du patrimoine est interessante mais comme dit dans un autre commentaire, quand on l’a vu une fois en effet pourquoi rester juste pour ça…

Je n’investis pas en crypto via Finary et le ferai pas (je le fais tout seul). 

Je trouve que les vidéos du fondateur sont utiles  pour évangéliser sur la finance personnelle et plutôt bien faites. 

En résumé, je pense qu’à moins d’avoir un patrimoine assez important et diversifié, Finary n’est pas très utile et peut être cher. Dans mon cas (holding, sci, AV, CTO, PEA, Private Equity, immobilier, crypto…) Finary me permet de gagner du temps."

Perso je n’arrive pas à attendre 6 mois à lire énormément de choses sur un sujet avant de le lancer; je me renseigne basiquement, je me lance , je me fais mon début d’expérience, je me renseigne encore (par exemple aujourd’hui précisément avec ce sub et ton commentaire bienvenu), je réajuste, et la boucle n’est certainement pas bouclée: elle continue et continue et continue.

Oui c’est sexy, perso je ne vois pas tant sa trogne si souvent que ça (j’ai Finary sur mobile principalement), j’aime avoir un bien meilleur visuel que sur mes excels, j’aime surtout pas de temps à y consacrer entre mon boulot et mes gamins donc ça me va très bien, et pour les frais… c’est un bien pour un mal, à mon stade j’ai l’impression que quoi que je fasse je peux découvrir 6mois/2ans plus tard que c’était une arnaque, trop cher, pas sûr, ou X mauvaises raisons d’y avoir souscris.

Donc perso ça me permet de me lancer, de voir comment ça marche, mais à 100% ça participe à mon éducation financière …

Je garde ton avis dans un coin de ma tête , et je le pencherai sur ça plus tard .

Toutefois je conçois que comme ceux qui préfèrent commander sur uber eats plutôt que de cuisiner, l'utilisation d'un tel service dépend des priorités d'allocation du temps personnelles.

Pour nuancer (même si ça a déjà été fait en commentaires), Finary semble prendre la direction au vu de leur roadmap d'un service non seulement de suivi des finances personnelles bien pensé et moderne mais également d'investissement. Le PEA devrait arriver pour 2026 (https://finarywealth.notion.site/Finary-Roadmap-publique-d7b515028f254e21bc198a9d9d819821). J'attends personnellement avec impatience de pouvoir enfin gérer mon PEA sur un outil minimaliste, simple, efficient et MODERNE (ps : j'utilise Fortuneo que je considère comme arriéré au vu de la latence de l'utilisation de l'outil, ainsi que de l'UX). Finary pourrait être ce nouveau Boursorama des 20 prochaines années qui non seulement éduque sur un sujet parfois rendu trop opaque que ce soit par la terminologie complexe, ou encore par l'UX/UI des outils aujourd'hui disponibles sur le marché, mais également une banque d'investissement complète pour une nouvelle génération désireuse de prendre en main facilement la gestion de ses finances. Il serait temps vu le niveau d'éducation des français sur le sujet."

Par contre je te trouve un peu dur envers le fondateur et la communauté.

Le fondateur, je sais pas si ses intentions sont celles qu’il prétend mais laissons lui le bénéfice du doute : son projet (ou sa vision) est interessante et il a le mérite d’essayer de le concrétiser en essayant d’être rentable au plus vite. Le fait qu’on voit sa trogne partout c’est purement marketing. Ça me parait pas illogique que le site se présente comme l’alternative ultime a tous ses concurrents : tout le monde fait ça. Ce qu’il vende c’est leur objectif, et j’imagine (j’espère)qu’ils sont convaincus que c’est le service qu’il vont finir par rendre. Stratégie carrément risquée, a sa place je me serai attendu a perdre énormément de clients, mais bon ca a l’air de fonctionner.

La communauté, elle est finalement assez critique. J’ai vu passer beaucoup de posts coup de gueule un peu comme le tiens, parce qu’évidemment c’est tellement buggé que c’est inutilisable. Notamment sur le post que tu cite il y en a beaucoup qui ont répondu de manière très négative, certains en ont même profité pour aller mettre une note de merde sur Trustpilot. Par contre je comprend pas ceux qui gardent leur abonnement… c’est déjà trop cher pour un service qui fonctionne, alors un qui est tout éclaté…

Je ne comprends pas cette approche ""à charge"" : il y a du bien et du moins bien, comme dans un certain nombre de produits, mais de là à le qualifier ""d'arnaque"", il y a un pas que je ne franchirais pas.

Pour être totalement transparent, je suis abonné à Finary depuis 2 ans. Pour les mêmes raisons que certains ont déjà évoquées (instabilité des synchronisations, faible réactivité du service client, ...) je ne renouvellerait pas mon abonnement. Au-delà de ces faits qui ont pesé dans ma décision, c'est surtout parce que je me suis mis à Portfolio Performance depuis. C'est une autre approche (beaucoup plus personnalisable) qui a donc ses avantages ... et son lot d'inconvénients.

Je suis également en phase avec ce qui a été dit plus haut : le public auquel Finary s'adresse vise à mon sens les débutants, néophytes, personnes qui ne regardaient pas leurs finances,... 

Pour moi, Finary a été un déclencheur (pour m'interesser de près à mon épargne) et je leur suis donc reconnaissant.

Bref, en conclusion, je dirais que ce post est intéressant mais manque cruellement de nuance, ce qui est fort dommage (le titre très ""clickbait"" est une bonne illustration)."

>Affirmer que les utilisateurs satisfaits de Finary sont juste des moutons idiots qui se font plumer est une exagération énorme,

J’ai jamais affirmé que qui que ce soit était un mouton idiot. Je suis comme tout le monde consommateur d’un produit et lorsqu’il nous semble mal fichu c’est notre devoir que de le mettre en évidence avec plus ou moins de virulence.

>surtout quand on regarde le nombre de véritables arnaqueurs dans l'écosystème de la finance personnelle.

Plutôt d’accord.

>Concernant l'application, l'incompatibilité avec de nombreuses banques m'a refroidi, et c'est pourquoi je ne suis pas client. Mais ce problème n'est pas forcément imputable à Finary. Les banques, en effet, ne jouent pas le jeu de l'Open Banking malgré la DSP2.

Oui.

>Finary propose un service avec une promesse claire. Rien n'empêche de l'essayer ou non. Où est l'arnaque ? Il y a une période d'essai de 14 jours pour tester et se désabonner sans frais !

Encore heureux, c’est la loi.

>Ce genre de critique est typique des cercles d'experts. Tout le monde valide OP en répétant que Finary est une arnaque et que ses utilisateurs sont des moutons, sans jamais proposer de solution aussi pratique. Gérer tout cela dans un fichier Excel ? Soyons sérieux.

Pour le coup, [Ce lien](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)  a été partagé pour se renseigner sur ce que ça signifie de confier des données à une app vs. les mettre dans un fichier ouvert. Excel, justement, **soyons sérieux.** Les tableaux et tables c’est probablement l’assurance du passé et de l’avenir, de la stabilité, du contrôle et de la maitrise de ses valeurs. Alors qu’une fintech française dont on ne sait pas ce qu’il adviendra (et souhaitons lui le meilleur) dans cinq ans, sans possibilité d’export, ça me fait froid dans le dos. Sans parler des bugs et des soucis. Si j’ai besoin de fonctionnalités, je les fait moi-même avec mes tableaux. Pas besoin d’être dépendant d’autrui. (indépendance pas que financière ;)) En voilà un gage de sérieux.

>La chaîne YouTube de Finary vise à sensibiliser des débutants, des personnes qui ne s'intéressaient pas auparavant à la gestion de leurs finances personnelles. L'application cible aussi ceux qui n'ont pas envie de perdre du temps avec des exports de données et leur intégration dans des tableaux Excel.

Encore une fois, rentrer des valeurs une fois par mois dans un tableau, c’est pas perdre du temps. S’occuper de ses sous, c’est comme s’occuper du reste, ça prend un peu de temps.

>Finary, c'est cher, et ses graphiques Sankey ne servent à rien ? Très bien, mais combien de temps OP consacre-t-il à gérer son fichier Excel,

Dix minutes par mois, et encore, j’aime les courbes.

> et en tire-t-il réellement plus de fonctionnalités que celles proposées par Finary ?

Oui sans aucun doute puisque c’est moi qui décide ce dont j’ai besoin.

>Il serait intéressant qu'OP partage un modèle de son fichier Excel et sa stratégie de suivi pour qu'on puisse comparer.

D’accord, tu me fais un virement automatique de 150€/an ?

>Oui, c'est possible de gérer par un fichier Excel, mais ça n'est pas l'approche de simplification des applications comme Finary. Leur stratégie est d'augmenter la base de clientèle en faisant la promotion de la finance personnelle aux néophytes. Ces néophytes devenant plus expérimentés avec le temps sauront dire s'ils préfèrent y passer plus de temps avec une gestion plus complexe ou garder Finary.

Belle conclusion et je la partage entièrement, mais si on peut éviter de gâcher un peu d’argent et de prendre les bonnes habitudes dès le début, c’est du travail en moins ensuite."

La vaste majorité de nos membres ne connaît rien à la finance avant de nous rejoindre ; le forum est une mine d’or pour eux. Je te rejoins néanmoins sur la modération, un point sur lequel nous devons progresser. Difficile de tout faire en même temps lorsqu’on croît si vite. Nous y travaillons.

• **Synchronisation** : difficile de te répondre en l’état, car tu ne partages pas les soucis rencontrés. Les synchronisations sont-elles parfaites ? Non, car les banques ne jouent pas toujours le jeu et bloquent les requêtes (ou ne maintiennent pas leurs API). Nous ne sommes pas parfaits sur tout, mais nous nous améliorons jour après jour.

• **Budget** : le budget est une nouveauté qui date de 2024, et nous continuons d’ajouter des fonctionnalités. Le découpage des transactions et la partie prévisionnelle sont à l’étude.

• **Export CSV** : c’est un sujet envisagé, il figure d’ailleurs sur notre roadmap publique (visible sur notre page d’accueil). Nous le re-prioriserons s’il venait à récolter plus de votes. C’est pareil pour toutes les fonctionnalités.

• **Historique** : j’imagine que tu parles de recréer un historique basé sur ton compte. Les transactions des comptes d’investissements ne sont pas structurées de façon à pouvoir le faire de manière fiable (et cela n’est pas prêt de changer car les banques bloquent le DSP3, alias l’Open Finance). Nous allons ajouter les “transactions manuelles” cette année, ce qui permettra d’“outrepasser” les données synchronisées. Difficile de faire mieux avec les données actuelles.

• **Revente de données** : nous ne revendons pas les données et ne le ferons jamais. Le tracking est utilisé pour des outils comme Amplitude ou pour optimiser nos publicités. J’aimerais bien comprendre comment on est censé monter un business en 2025 sans utiliser ces trackers !

• **Prix** : l’abonnement est un vote. Il permet d’aligner nos intérêts avec ceux de nos clients. S’ils sont satisfaits, ils paient. Sinon, ils partent. Notre rétention d’une année sur l’autre est excellente pour du B2C : plus de 60 %. Nous continuons de travailler dur pour proposer un accompagnement qui va encore plus loin. Ce business model est, à mon sens, le seul qui soit valable. Nos concurrents qui ont opté pour de la pub in-app ont tous coulé (ou sont des zombies).

• **Alternatives** : il existe beaucoup de super outils pour suivre son patrimoine gratuitement, et chacun est libre d’utiliser celui qui lui correspond le mieux (ou de lancer une meilleure alternative)."
