You don’t need to babysit her or get her to her room. You’re kinda making it easy for her to raise suspicion in others. Do your job then go back to your hotel room. You don’t need to organize meals with her. You seem like you’re still trying to be “nice” to Mary which leads it to be easy for her to play you. And start making a paper trail.

***Dude, you're doing this to yourself.*** Quit babying her on these work trips. If she gets drunk, leave her alone and let her find her own way to her room.

Because of your chivalry, you're not letting her fail and potentially getting fired. Leave her to her own devices, and whenever y'all are together, record her and document, document, and document. Leave a paper trail if you can. Put your foot down with your manager regarding Mary.

There is no work related task where you need to sit with her while she gets wasted that she has to be escorted to her room.

Stop interacting with her at all outside of work meetings. No dinners. No drinks. It doesn’t matter if you don’t drink if you’re still hanging out with Mary. 

And shame on you for not immediately squashing the lie Mary told in front of your managers wife. You should have loudly rebuked that in front of everyone and I would’ve even gone further to say “that sounds exactly like some of the rumors someone spread about me and Caroline, Mary did you start those rumors??” 

Just resign and in your exit interview let them know Mary is the reason. You already told management you were uncomfortable with Mary and her sexual lies about you. You have the grounds to sue your workplace based off of sexual harassment and the fact that they keep pairing you up with her for travel. 


Stop being a passenger in your own demise and take the wheel. Get an attorney and have them draft a letter about the harassment and how you need to NOT work with Mary anymore. If your job fires you then perfect you get unemployment and can sue them back since all of what you told your manager and HR should already be documented from their investigation into Caroline."

Why the actual fuck are you sitting with Mary in the evening while she gets drunk, let alone taking her to her room? 

You are neither her partner nor her parent. And honestly it's becoming clear that you love the drama because anyone in your shoes would walk away from her at the end of your working day and leave her to do whatever she wants to do in the evenings, as opposed to keeping her company.

You no longer eat or socialize with Mary on these trips

You do your job, you go back to your room, you order pizza

You don't go to dinner with her

You don't go to a bar with her

You straight up tell her *I have decided to not socialize with women one on one when my wife is not around.  I have been speaking to my pastor about my job and having to travel with women for work...and he made me realize that I need to be more respectful of my marriage vows and not put myself in any position where people might miscontstrue what is going on.  For instance we're just 2 coworkers but if we were having dinner together, it may look like a date.  There was just something about the way he said it that made me realize I need to be more mindful of how my choices affect others.   My faith is very important to me and I believe this is the right decision for myself, my marriage, and my faith journey.*

What is Mary gonna do...complain to your boss that your religious beliefs no longer allow you to socialize with women one on one?

That's a good way for a discrimination lawsuit

Travel with a bible too.  

I know it sucks to use religion like this but if HR is not going to help you, then it's time you tried something else"

But you will be if you don't listen to your wife. If you really can't afford to quit, tell your manager that if you MUST travel with Mary, that you need a separate hotel she does not know about. Tell them how she always gets drunk on these trips and acts unprofessional. No longer be nice to her. Don't have dinner with her. Don't help her drunk ass to her room. 

If it happens again where she gets shit faced, film her and show it to HR/ your manager. Tell them you will not deal with a belligerent drunk on company time. Tell them she is misrepresenting the company by doing this. 

Otherwise get the fuck out of that job and find somewhere else to work, even if it is less pay. That is the only way you're going to keep your wife."

""Due to Mary's alcoholic behavior, I've been put in the awful position of having to escort her to her room, out of fear someone would call the cops on her since she couldn't get back to her room by herself."" Be brutal. 

I'd make her hate me if I were in this situation.

Mary is a walking trouble.  She doesn’t need to cause any actual issues with your work.  She just needs to drop small fabricated lies into her story that can easily be manipulated to change people views.

Her telling the story of you “staying” by her side when she was drunk sounds like it can be seen as two things:  she has “rose tinted” glasses of you hence her insisting that you are a gentleman.  Or, from those who may not have a kind view of you might see you as a creep who could’ve easily taken advantage of someone in a vulnerable state. Either way, the optics are not good even from a professional standpoint.  And I think it might do you some good to talk to an employment lawyer to see what’s the best way to protect yourself from Mary in case if she tries to ruin your career with these subtle false lies.

The longer you stay within working proximity and even have a professional relationship out of office hours (like dinner and breakfast), the more likely Mary will build up false narratives that can really ruin your career."

In fact, as has been pointed out, you are too nice. Don't be mean. Be distant. She is *not* your work-sister.

Get it through your head that this woman is screwing you, your wife, and your career over. Who knows how she justifies her behavior in her head, but she will only stop when she has either ruined you or trapped you.

You need LC with Mary. No engagement beyond absolutely required for work. Treat her like a leper. You don't even want to be within touching distance with her.

- If she just walks into your office, you get up and leaver your office/cubicle immediately, and if she follows you, tell her you are going to the bathroom.
- Say as little to her as necessary, in front of other people, and walk away asap
- If it's a business discussion, only meet her in a meeting room, and try to include other people.
- book different hotels, even fly/travel at different times. 
- if you and Brooke socialize at the company, keep your wife by your side. If Mary joins your group as you chat, coincidentally leave to talk to someone else, get another drink, etc. You want the loner in the corner to be entertained, watching as Mary chases you and your wife around at the party, clearly wanting nothing to do with her. Let her embarrass herself.

If she tries to ask why, tell her you don't have to explain yourself to her, then ask if she has work related questions for you. If not, walk away."

Yes, you don't have proof, but you DID have a paper trail of asking for a new partner to travel with. Add the text messages and the fact that this is sexual harassment to make the job take it seriously and let them know you are seriously thinking of taking legal steps on hostile work environment and sexual harassment. Give them a timeline.

Heck, I would also talk to Carolina and see if she is interested in making a defamation lawsuit, because you could be happy to be a witness and have all of your tech be used as evidence that defamation happened, because that's what she should've done to both the company and her asshole ex. Because, yeah, what they did was defamation of her character and they *have* ruined her career, that comes with consequences. HR is going to want to chop heads off if they have a real lawsuit on their hands and it turns out it's because of a rumor. (All the better if they aim it at Mary) 

If you also must have another trip with her, don't help her. If she decides to get hammered, that's her problem. If she winds up with someone who takes advantage of her, then consider that her karmic punishment for sexually harassing you and ruining at least one person's career. (And, frankly, the Marys of this world are never that drunk, they're just doing the ""wounded gazelle gambit"" trick. They are all upright when their target doesn't bite and shows zero sympathy).

She starts drinking, you start leaving. 

Don't be nice to her and, if you can, start giving her very unimpressed looks and be curt with her. Not rude, just curt and like you want to finish the conversation as fast as possible. 

The only other nuclear option is to do to Mary what Mary did to Carolina, as in have a friend do an anonymous tip off that Mary did something screwed up. But that requires a specific mentality"

It boggles my mind that there is no one else that you can take these trips with. Discuss options from pairing you with a man, to staying at different hotel. I would share suspicions about sabotaging Carolina, about Mary preying on your good nature by purposefully getting inebriated and in effect forcing you to take care of her, and describe her apparent obsession. Frankly, I am surprised after the Carolina scandal that HR wouldn't have implemented new rules. If Manager refuses to pair you with a man or allow you to stay in a different hotel, then make it clear that unless it is a client dinner, you will NOT be sharing meals with Mary. I can't remember if you drive together too, but that is something that you can refuse to do as well. Mary may have played herself because this last story gives you the perfect excuse: Brooke is uncomfortable and has asked me not to (drive/eat/drink) with you. Definitely recommend that if you HAVE to stay at same hotel, you change room numbers and instruct front desk not to share your information with anyone. And for all that is holy, do not answer her calls, respond via text so that all communications are in writing. Or better yet, use company IM or email if you both have phone access."

I generally avoid drinking on these trips now. There were a few times where she insistent that I get a beer, but I told her that I am already on thin ice at work, and promised Brooke I will not drink on these trips. This has not stopped her from getting hammered and me having to drop her to her room at the end of the day few times.

literal idiot. NO you don't have to drop her at her room, ever. NO you don't have to have dinner with her, ever. You go to business meetings with her, you never go with her to eat, never drink with her, never take her to her room. She arranges meals for us, and you can just say no thanks and walk and go anywhere else to eat. What kind of idiot goes oh well the woman trying to ruin my marriage arranged a meal for two for us, what choice to I have but have the meal with her.

If she gets smashed in the hotel bar and calls you, you call security, you have them take her to her room, you have them write a report and you hand it in to HR.

Jesus fucking christ, no wonder your wife doesn't trust you, you're an idiot. You also decided to spend loads of time privately in an office to have discussions you could have over the phone or in the break room with someone that you were rumoured to be having an affair with.

You're blaming Mary, and she could be to blame, but your own actions are god damned moronic. Honestly this almost sounds like you just had two affairs and are writing these posts to try to convince your wife you aren't.

She says you took her to her room and went inside, you told your wife you didn't... who could ever have envisaged such a situation? Right, everyone. If you just refused to spend evenings with her and if she got drunk leave it to security or have them call an ambulance, Mary would have long since been fired.

Also a tracking app, yeah you're in the same hotel she is, how would that help in any way.

You're legitimately an idiot and industry.... most industries are not so limited that you can transfer skills to another industry easily. Get a new job because you're clearly unwilling to do anythign to get rid of Mary.

If this is remotely real and your wife is reading this, leave this idiot. He's just that fucking stupid that you'd do better and have less problems with someone else. Do you want a husband who can't tell a woman disrespecting you and trying to start an affair that he can't have dinner with her and watches her get drunk around him rather than just leaving. Pathetic. He's either too stupid for you to stay married to, or gaslighting you and having affairs."

You shouldn't have been having dinner with her, full stop. You are *choosing* to put yourself in these ridiculous situations with a psychotic liar who has already destroyed *one* person's career to get close to you, and you are STILL engaging with her? Your work cannot force you to travel and dine with someone who is clearly out to get close to you. You could have said no and filed for sexual harassment as everybody on here advised you to do. You CHOSE not to.

There should never have been *another* situation where this creature could have lied about you, and you not only ate with her, but you went to her room? Regardless of whether you say you entered or not, your behaviour was already inappropriate. She's now made that statement in front of your manager's wife (and it doesn't sound like you even objected or corrected her), who has already been told that you have had an inappropriate relationship with a co-worker and then secretly told her BF. There is nothing you can ever say to fix your reputation, and quite frankly, at this point, you deserve what you get.

Resignation is your only option. Your wife is done, not only with Mary's BS, but with YOURS - that's why you guys argued. She no longer easily trusts you, and there's a very good reason for that. It wouldn't surprise me if your marriage crumbles because you're so happy to risk it by being polite to people who want to destroy it instead of telling them to *leave you alone.* Shame on you for not resigning sooner and letting this situation continue to get worse. But at this point, you only have yourself to blame. Talk to a lawyer about the sexual harassment, but I doubt a lawyer would take your case after how you have continually re-engaged with her."

You need to tell her you don’t want to spend time with her.

Giving her these excuses is letting her tell herself that you’d spend time and attention on her except for outside pressure.

You need to make all your own dinner plans and refuse to spend time with her after the work tasks are done. Find some sort of gym with locations in multiple cities, and go to the gym (but don’t tell Mary where you’re going!).

“Sorry, Mary, this is my time to wind down. I’m not interested in having dinner with your, or in hanging out.” Even if you’re hiding in your room. But better yet is leaving the hotel so she knows/thinks you’re not around, or she’ll knock on your door, or something.

  
You shouldn’t even be AROUND when Mary gets drunk at the bar. You should be physically elsewhere. 

Heck, call Brooke on the phone at 6:00 and chat while you eat dinner from Room Service, and watch a movie together. 

I don’t know how that would stop her from lying about it to everyone, but at least Brooke will know where you are. However, Brooke is right that Mary is going to tank your career, and I would take that concern to HR again.

After your next work trip where nothing happens, Mary is going to accuse you of sexual assault/harrassment and you are not gonna get out of that one unless you cut this at the roots now.

It's been fucking months! And you let your wife and yourself go through with this? Even going so far as to let another female coworker take the fall for you not handling this as well as you should have?

I would honestly, no joke, use the ""unsafe work environment"" (because she's making it one) route and pursue legal action if they continue to force you to interact with Mary.

She is going to escalate. She will accuse you of rape if she does not get what she wants. You will lose your job, your wife, and possibly your life as a free man. She has possibly already done this to a coworker (not rape, but a false allegation that ruined her relationship and career).

Either law down the law that you no longer interact with Mary AT ALL or pursue legal action while you find alternative employment. This is not ok in any way.

 If the roles were reversed, do you think the company would force a woman to go alone on trips with a man who acts the way she acts towards you?"

Okay, you mentioned a government job and optics. Do you know how horrible this looks? 


That's not your responsibility. That's not your job description. If she gets drunk that's on her. You should be documenting that and sending it to HR as not your job and not your responsibility and makes you uncomfortable as a male, being left alone with a vulnerable female who has boundary issues. 


Talk to HR. Reference your tracker on your phone and that you've never been in the room and the conversation that the boss's wife heard. 


Sexual harassment and the workplace goes both ways. I would also strongly suggest that they look into it lest they get sued for a hostile work environment"

Did Mary say that in front of your wife and your managers wife? You need to talk to your manager about this ASAP. Tell them about Mary making up stories and the impact it is having on your marriage. Show them your text messages with time stamps, if you are comfortable doing so. Explain the untrue rumors going around about you and Caroline and your suspicions that Mary is the source. Complain that Mary is getting drunk on work trips and you find it unprofessional. Ask him for guidance on this. 

If you can’t stop traveling with her: My suggestion is that you start with refusing to join her outside of work related meetings. No “discussing work at dinner” or anything like that. You get your work done and you do not see her for the rest of the night. If Mary gets hammered at the hotel bar, you need to request that a hotel employee escort you both back to her room so you have a witness. Will this embarrass Mary and possibly you? Yeah probably, but you need to make extraordinary efforts to preserve your marriage if you can’t leave your job. I am concerned Mary’s plan is to claim you assaulted her.

After the meeting, send him a follow up email detailing your complaint. Include whatever plan you two have come up with to deal with this. If he does not agree to a plan, make sure you state “I know you have not signed off on this but going forward until the company has resolved this, I will be handling this situation by doing X/Y/Z.”

My husband traveled for work extensively; I'm talking weeks, a month, even a couple of 2-3 month jobs away. He was doing commercial carpentry and worked for multiple different companies. Not one of those companies required anything of him after working hours, as in, he did not have to go out to dinner with his co-workers if he didn't want to. He didn't have to even see or talk to them for the remainder of the day, if he didn't want to. They were always roomed at the same hotel but sometimes never saw each other outside of work. That isn't something a company can require of you, unless they want to pay you for dictating your 'free-time'.

INFO: OP, *why* do you continue to engage with this woman outside of your working day? You can get your dinner on your own, you can have breakfast on your own. Any communication regarding work that is needed can be done through e-mail or text, which will be better anyway for proof of all interactions. Do not share room numbers and request a room away from hers. Your co-worker is dealing with some serious mental issues here. I would interact with her as little as possible outside of work and at work, as well, if possible. Do you have to ride in the same vehicle? If not, travel separate. I'd seriously watch your back here, OP. This lady is serious. She obviously doesn't care who she hurts to get you for more than her 'work-husband'. And yes, I fully agree with you on the 'work-spouse' terminology, OP. It's just weird and suspicious to me, especially when one party seems obsessed with the idea. 

NTA but you need to take this a little more serious, imo. Your co-worker obviously has no remorse for sabotaging Carolina's career and life, just to get her way of traveling with you again. She was obviously jealous that Carolina was working with you when she wanted it to be her. She did what she had to do to remove the threat. I would honestly consider some security upgrades for your home. I assume she knows where you live? If you leave for a new job she might not handle that well. Cut all unnecessary contact with this woman immediately. Keep it strictly work and no more. Keep looking for work, too. If you can get out, you should. Do NOT let her know or find out where you go. Mary is scary. At least, I would definitely treat her as so, being she obviously does not seem to care about nor follow social norms and rules. She does whatever she needs to do to get her way. Run a background check on her. Report this to HR-all of it. Hell, report it to the local PD just to start a file. Don't let this lady ruin your life.

Or ruin your marriage over a situation you did nothing wrong in. You’ve done the right thing by staying faithful to your wife, but do you really think Mary’s interference in your personal life will stop here? One lie about you taking care of her while she was drunk has already caused damage—what happens when she escalates?

If you let this continue, it’s only a matter of time before she fabricates enough “evidence” to convince your wife, just like she manipulated Carolina.

You need to take a firm stand:
“Either I have no interaction with Mary whatsoever, or you will need to fire me. I refuse to work with her any further. My wife comes first, and Mary’s behavior has made me, my wife, and the entire office uncomfortable.”

Frankly, the fact that you work in a four-person department makes it surprising you haven’t done this sooner. If they could afford to let you go over Mary’s inappropriate behavior, they likely would have fired her by now. It’s time to prioritize yourself and your marriage before things get worse."

1. You need to not engage with Mary on those work trips.  No accepting her ask for drinks at the hotel bar.  No dinners together.  Your work may arrange your hotel accommodations, so you may not be able to separate hotels, but work with Brooke to come up with half a dozen ""gentle no's"".  But if they aren't accepted, just say ""sorry, no can do"" and walk away.
2. Brooke sucks too.  Brooke has no reason to amplify Mary's message that you are clumsy, forgetful, and need to be taken care of on work trips TO YOUR MANAGER'S WIFE.  That is making you look bad as a professional.  Just No.  I'm sure she didn't realize she was being set up by Mary at the time, and it seemed like harmless chit-chat, but she was, and she needs to realize that she paved the way for Mary's lies
3. Mary of course sucks for lying to your wife in front of your boss's wife, and for anything else she may have done

You need to document the incident where Mary lied, and go to HR.  When did the drunk/hotel incident occur?  Call the hotel and ask them if they would still have surveillance tape of the floor in question for that date and time, that would show you escorted a woman to her room but did not enter it.  Write down whatever you can remember - dates, times, etc.  The timestamped texts.  Tell HR that you need to document that Mary lied in front of your manager's wife, stating that you entered her room and stayed there for a while, and that you feel it is unwise to have fodder for rumors about potential inappropriate actions (even though at present, Mary is not alleging that inappropriate behavior on your part occurred).  Ask if you can be switched from traveling with Mary because of these lies.

Follow up your meeting with an email summarizing it to HR.  Talk to your manager, and send him a copy of the email.

Good luck"

Definitely talk to the manager and explain that it needs to be changed. Her lying so fluently to your wife right in front of you is the last straw. She clearly has no difficulty in creating damaging scenarios for work colleagues. Interesting how I get a new travel buddy and steely there's a complaint and I'm put back with Mary.

If they refuse etc. Say ok well, I want to make a record of the awkward situations and inappropriate behavior of Mary on work trips and functions, such as her reaction to my declining her request to dance with her. Also that the office gossip be looked into properly.

Can't remember if you said the type of work you do but honestly, it may be work taking time off if they can't swap you to someone else. Doesn't matter if staff are refusing to work tower l with you! No two should always be together on work trips because that's how this bs starts!

Tell them that everything she has been saying is a lie and that she’s setting you up, and if they do not have a meeting with her about her behavior AND if they continue making you travel with her then you will have no choice but to resign bc you will not allow this horrible woman to ruin your life. All it would take is her getting jealous of your wife or another coworker again for her to ruin your entire life.

You just keep walking yourself into these situations giving Mary more ammunition. I get you’re trying to be a nice guy and in any other case I would applaud you but in this case where the history is so dicey, I can’t help but wonder WTH you’re doing other than hurting Brooke. I guarantee you Brooke’s peace of mind is nonexistent since all of these allegations started, even if she says she believes you it’s still a question in the back of her head of “what if?”"

Depending on where you live, you might have a claim. I think it would be worth looking into. In the meantime, here are some ideas off the top of my head:

* Do not be alone with her. Ever.
* If she tries to talk to you in your office, get up immediately and move out into a public area.
* I think that you should start treating Mary the same way you would a man. If she gets so drunk she can't stand up, then she's on her own to get back to the room. 
* And check the rules where you travel about recording laws. If you go somewhere with one party consent, see if you can take some videos about her behavior. 
* Stop eating dinner with her. Stop walking her to her room. Just stop interacting with her in any way except strictly job related. 
* And seriously, stay at a different hotel. That will cut down on her opportunities for shenanigans. Let her stay closest to wherever you are meeting. 
* Go to the client meetings and depart immediately. 

I really do think you've got a legitimate harassment complaint. If a man were treating a woman this way, no one would argue it. If you are in the US, you can talk to your local EEOC office for free."

Find a lawyer. Find out what your options are in regards to how to handle this situation at work. In the meantime, anytime you have to interact with Mary call in sIck. Make it very obvious that you don’t wanna be around Mary. If you trust your manager, bring all the evidence that you have to your manager and show him that her stories are not match. Let him know that you believe she contributed to the HR investigation against Carolina and that not even your wife believes you cheated on her. Once you have your ducks in a row, go to HR.

But I do agree with your wife that you have to interact anymore with Marie you’re gonna need to resign.

People like Mary do this all the time you are playing tiddlywinks and she’s playing chess. I don’t think you should fuck around anymore. It took you too long to listen to your wife in every respect. So now I think you need to go to a lawyer and have them advise you on what your next steps should be professionally and legally.

If you share locations with your wife, make sure you have access to all where you were for whatever time. It always falls on the victim for evidence.

* **Set firm boundaries**: Reinforce with management that traveling with Mary is no longer an option due to the personal and professional risks involved. Relay your concerns about Caroline's departure. Perhaps even get an note from Caroline. I would consult a lawyer as well to see what risks are involved if Mary keeps up her behavior and what things the lawyer needs to protect your position. HR protects the company, not you, and a good lawyer is there for you - and is worth their weight in gold. The y can help you navigate this sticky situation, while also penning in ""company speak"" how this will go for your company if Mary isn't religated to a corner desk or let go.
* **Document everything**: Keep clear records of interactions with Mary and any concerning behavior to protect yourself in case of further escalation. Make sure instances are dated, along with quotes if you can. Your wife can also corroborate what she is telling others, and therefore creating a hostile work environment. Documentation should be given to your lawyer so they can draft a letter for your HR.
* **Continue networking**: Even in a tough job market, discreetly network within their industry to uncover opportunities that could help your career - think of it this way: If you have time to sit down with Mary to have dinner and let her get shitfaced, you can save that time to put towards networking instead.
* **Consider a long-term plan**: If staying in the job feels untenable, explore lateral moves within the company or plan for a future job search when the market improves. If there is a way to move to a new department, jump at the opportunity. The sunk cost fallacy is real here, and you will lose far more momentum to a sexual harassment case for rejecting Mary than you will by jumping to a new department or job.
* **Your well-being and marriage come first:** While not ideal, if this woman has every intention of inserting herself around at every chance you give, SHE WILL take it. She's clearly obsessed, manipulative, and it is hurting you and your wife. If all the above still doesn't result in the outcome you desire in the next 3 months, then you need to think of yourself and resign, with a detailed note from a lawyer as to why. This way, it sets the target on Mary's back after you leave.

You do not need that in your and your wife's life! If you cannot find a different job in your field, consider a career change, use it as a chance to expand your horizons. Get away from that woman! A mortgage can be dealt with, a move can be made, as long as you have your stable supportive partner with you. 

Get out of her grasp!"

You can get them on internet. Get manager to agree, in writing,  that you allowed to wear one especially when alone with Mary.

When you do have to go on work trips see if wife is able to join you on some of them. If she isn't then insist on different flight time from Mary. Don't speak to Mary except by text or email. Don't join her for meals, tell her that you are having meal with wife, have wife on zoom the whole time as if you are having dinner with wife and interact with wife only if Mary tries to interrupt you. Don't even share a cup of coffee with Mary. If she insists you need to meet make sure it's public where cameras besides your own are located. Don't share taxi or uber with Mary even if you have to pay for it yourself. Ask manager to put you in separate hotel if possible. If she tries coming to your room refuse to open door and text her to leave that she isn't welcome in your room. Outside of anything work related there should be no reason to interact with her. If she gets drunk again and wants you to take her back to her room have hotel staff escort her. Stop acting like a gentleman and start acting like a man who has been wronged by someone who is not only showing disrespect to you but also to your wife and marriage. After all if your willing to allow her to make a laughingstock of your wife and marriage then you really don't love your wife as much as you say you do.

Keep looking for a new job

She didn’t just tell that story to your wife, she told it in front of others and you didn’t disagree with her (“wow, you must have drunk a lot more than I realized because I never entered your hotel room and I called up Brooke immediately afterwards. At least I am glad to hear you thought I was a perfect gentlemen.”) Mary has successfully made you an unreliable narrator with your coworkers. I really do not understand why you haven’t gone to an employment lawyer with all this. Mary is sexually harassing you and she created a scenario where you don’t feel comfortable going to your own HR.

Something else you can do on these trips is refuse to have any social contact with Mary-tell her you are too busy with work to have dinner with her, no you won’t go to the bar with her, and FaceTime your wife whenever Mary is around (literally get out your phone and say “sorry, Brooke had a doctor’s appointment/big meeting/high school reunion/dance recital today and I really want to know how it went. See you tomorrow” and walk away). Literally never spend a non-work second with Mary without a witness or recording."

“Thank you for meeting with me. I need to draw a boundary with traveling with Mary. I didn’t want to say anything, as beyond this she’s good at her job and felt I could handle this privately but it’s has gotten to a point where I am very uncomfortable traveling with her. 

We were good team for a long time but she started to get very flirtatious. I made it clear that I wanted to keep things professional, and that I am married. 

She made an Office joke about being my work-wife and I joked back ‘more like a work sister’ so that no one would get the wrong impression that we were anything except a professional coworker team? This was on Date. She was clearly upset at this and I decided it was best to create distance. 

Now I don’t have any proof of this but I think it’s relevant. After I started traveling and working closely with Carolina, Mary seemed upset over this. Around the same time someone anonymously tipped off Carolinas boyfriend about a supposed to Office affair. It was alluded that I was the secret AP. She resigned over the inappropriate and frankly uncalled for rumors. I am suspicious that this was Mary who had caused these rumors and ‘tipped off’ her boyfriend. 

My girlfriend does not trust Mary and is stressed out every time we travel together. 

While traveling, I have made it a direct point to stay in my room after any work is done. Mary will often try and encourage me to join her at the bar. On more than one occasion she was so drunk that I felt she was putting herself in a compromised position. 

That brings us to now. At the holiday party, my wife, managers wife and Mary were having a conversation about our travels together. Mary told my wife that I take care of her and put her to bed and will stay in her room until she is asleep. This has caused my wife to become incredibly upset. While Mary has gotten fallen down drunk and I have made sure she got to her room safely I have never put myself in a compromising situation where I have entered her room and for her to say that to both my wife and the wife of my boss  makes me feel she’s setting something up where I’m going to be accused of something I didn’t do. I need to report this now before it gets any worse."

Agreed you need to draw a line with your employer. Dont ask for permission. Tell them what is going to happen. You will not be traveling with Mary any longer. If you’re that valuable to them they will break up the other team. If they don’t then you’re better off leaving. 

You also need to confront Mary for directly lying to your wife in front of your managers wife. And record the conversation!!!

This is not okay. You must make this situation come to a screeching halt. If not the future of your career and maybe even your marriage is at stake. I think Mary thinks she can wear you down. Seems like she will do anything to spend time with you and be your “travel buddy” again.

I understand you stopped drinking on the work trips but you really need to stop hanging out with this person outside of work meetings. There's some things you are doing here which are kind of silly and you need to stop it immediately.




Also, you need to email HR immediately and tell them that your co-worker is making you feel uncomfortable.  Do not go talk to HR in person, email them and make sure that there is a paper trail."

Obviously there are cons/possible issues. Management may not approve using company funds on separate locations (idk how it works - if they give you both your own cards for work expenses or pay ahead of time etc) They may not want you that separated if there isn’t another hotel in the immediate vicinity. If they would agree to this, it severely limits if not  cuts out all unnecessary interaction. Nothing outside of work related mingling. 

If they say they won’t pay for separate hotels, maybe they will allow you to pay out of pocket for it yourself. Which again, is not ideal BUT … if it lets you keep your career without losing the progress you’ve made while also reassuring your wife and alleviating her concerns, it might be worth it. Even if it’s just a temporary solution while you line up a different job. That way, you wouldn’t need to worry about finances and not having the money to pay the bills. 

I feel so sad for Carolina. That was a dirty low move from the “anonymous” coworker. I was really hoping she would be exonerated both at work and with her boyfriend. I simply cannot imagine those messages coming from anyone other than Mary. She is the only one that has clear motive, ample  opportunity and stands to benefit from Carolina being removed. I know it’s personal but if I were in your shoes, I probably would have reached out to her bf with the links of these posts so he can have a better understanding and more insight as to how their relationship came to end and why."

Now onto the social part, okay so that is actually a political problem : mary say X you say Y, what you did or did not doesn't matter that much , what count is what people will believe. If you try to fight her by just having the truth on your side, you will lose.

She's very obviously working overtime to make people believe her, and she had all the time in the world to spin her web of lies. Don't think for a second that getting bold enough to lie in front of your wife was the beginning, it was a mishap or her trying to close in on her prey, wich mean this is all in final phase.

Leverage that mishap : she lied about getting you in her bed. Even if she didn't pretend that you had sex, it's far enough to involved HR, make it documented that she's making up things about your behavior with her, that will be VERY important WHEN (and not IF) she understand that you're not gonna be her snack. Retaliation is absolutely guaranteed and when a girl spent some time lying about you being lovebird and want to get back at your the logical step is lying about you sexually assaulting her. You will want to have a HR paper trail about her making things up about you when that happen.

Make yourself as bulletproof as possible : activate gps tracking on your phone, use a mic if permitted in your state, call your wife directly in front of her if any 1:1 time seem happen, do NOT in any circumstance let yourself in a situation when somebody can say you were having some time with her and you can't prove that it's false in a hot minute.

  
If you're not sure that you can do all that AND get your company to have your back and be ready to defend you no matter what she come up with (that include never making you leave on a trip with her again), leave, even if it's a good job, it's not worth getting on house arrest for months and getting fired anyway for rape allegations.

  
Good luck, and one last time : YOU WILL GET ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, THE ONLY QUESTION IS WILL IT BE MISCONDUCT OR RAPE. Do NOT make the mistake of thinking that it won't happen if you are careful enough, it's almost a certainty that it will happen, you got all the red flags saying that it will."

And then you go and make the unbelievably stupid decision to go on these work trips with this woman you know is manipulative, conniving, and not above destroying someone’s career and life, and you ESCORT HER BACK TO HER ROOM because SHE’S TOO DRUNK to go by herself. She could tell anyone any story about those walks to her room, as you’ve now discovered. You’ll be lucky if she doesn’t get angry at some point and claim that you took advantage of her on those work trips.

Everyone here said, “Don’t be alone with her.” That meant, “don’t be alone with her.” That didn’t mean go hang out at the bar, not drinking while she drinks, then walk her to her room once she’s hammered. It also doesn’t mean go hang out in your room while she gets drunk at the bar, then calls you and says she’s too drunk to walk to her room alone, then you go walk her to her room.

You need to start thinking like a woman. Realize when you’re prey, in the presence of a predator. Grow a sense of self-preservation. Jesus, dude.

And if this IS fiction, your leading character is painfully gullible and readers will eventually stop rooting for him, because these are mostly avoidable disasters of his own making."

I’m used to going up to someone, whoever they are, and speaking my mind ending whatever is bothering me or them at that same moment (or at least trying), in offices that seems impossible.

The only times I had trouble communicating in my job was one time when HR got involved (funny enough), and made speaking openly and honestly a bad idea for anyone that tried.

1. Why are you still spending time with Mary after work hours? You should not be drinking with her let alone walking her to her room.


2. Why have you not filed a complaint against Mary about her inappropriate behavior? both at this office party and on the work trips.


3. Why did you not negate Mary's false claims about you being in her room? These statements, TO YOUR BOSS'S WIFE, were both disgusting and embarrassing for your wife. The fact that you just stood their with your dick in your hand not refuting her insinuations was insanely idiotic.


Honestly OP if I was your wife I would think you enjoy Mary's attention because you have realistically done little to protect yourself but keep claiming to be a victim of this ""crazy lady"". "

Your ass isn't a hat, but you're sure still trying to make it one.

Mary obviously created this entire situation. She made the initial work husband comment, she cried about it at her desk, she confronted you about how being ""turned down"" makes her look, she was unwilling to compromise on how to treat you at work, she's acted insensitive to both you and your wife (who you apparently value, yet we have no reason to believe that from anything written so far), she's extremely likely to have ended your coworker's job over her own petty jealousy and manipulation (which isn't up for debate as she's literally lied to you and your wife's face), and has shown zero remorse for any of her actions or the troubles she's caused you.

What was your response to all of that for the past several months? Tell your wife. Report her to HR with the exaggeration that you don't actually want to report her, just bookmark the events, but only after several days had passed since the event happened to begin with. Heaven forbid that you stop drinking entirely while on these trips, but congrats on bringing yourself to drink *less* than you normally would. She crossed several boundaries for not only you, but your wife as well, on several different occasions, and your solution to that was to walk her back to her room?

This is either the longest running karma-farm series of posts I've seen, or you are just really that dense. You cannot honestly believe that you've done nothing wrong. News flash, when someone confronts you like this, trying to people please and back pedal does way more harm than just standing up and dealing with the problem, something you have yet to actually do. You told HR you didn't want to work with her, but that was about it. What else have you actually done to reach a conclusion to this situation that are unmistakenly in? Same as before; tell your wife. Do you expect her to do it for you? Yeah obviously tell her, but then **DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT** afterwards!

This has only been happening for as long as you've let it happen, which has been this entire time. You could have done something about this when she called you her work-husband. You didn't. You could have done something when she confronted you in your office. You didn't. It wasn't until you got home and your wife had to tell you what to do (as well as apparently being persuaded by your previous posts) that you took *some* action by making an unofficial report of events to HR, who had already heard it from literally everyone but you, about the drinking incident. Sabotaging your coworker's career? ""There's no proof"". Creating a hostile work environment by spreading rumors through coworkers? ""I think she's doing it but can't prove it"".

Do you see the pattern here? At all? Or are you going to pretend to be oblivious to that too in order to make it easier on yourself?

You're very clearly not the one creating the issue, but you are doing absolutely nothing to stop it, which does in fact hurt you in the end anyways. Turns out that if you just stand there and watch a wildfire, it won't put itself out. Who knew right?

Your wife deserves someone who will take the initiative to protect the marriage, not just hold it like some collector's item that's cherished as a possession. You claim you don't want anyone calling you their husband other than your wife, but you seem pretty chill about letting this lunatic Mary essentially insert herself into several parts of your life while you do absolutely nothing to keep her at a distance.

This makes my heart break for your wife, who had nothing to with the creation of the situation, unlike yourself, yet she has taken more measure **than you yourself have taken** to create a solution to this.

What are you waiting for before you step up? How many more new hires have to lose their job before you do what you should have done months ago? How much more stress is your wife going to go through having to deal with this while everyone actually involved does nothing but make the situation worse?

What is it going to take for you to actually do something about this?

Right now, YTA, Mary is a bigger one, and your wife **should be concerned over your lack of action to fix this real problem**

I really, really hope this is fake and I've just wasted the last few minutes typing this out."

I had a situation like this at my job once, and I drew a line in the sand. I  told human resources that I was afraid of what this woman was doing behind closed doors. Take separate trips. Stay in separate hotels. Eventually, at work, she will come to you and say
I thought we were close. You used to be my work husband. 
You can then say my associations with you have cost me peace at home, and I don't wanna lose my job. Folks are talking. So let's just keep this on the professional here on out.
Once you put her ass on notice, tell HR everything, and if you must deal with her, record everything because you are dealing with a snake.  If you're not careful, you'll get bitten.

You should never have been in a position to “take care” of drunk Mary. As in: shouldn’t be in a situation where this can even arise. That’s totally within your control. You should not be engaging in ANY socializing with this woman outside of work - and by work, I mean WORK, not a work lunch, not a hotel work dinner, and certainly not work cocktails, whether you’re drinking or not. Do not break bread with her. WTF are you thinking? ~~It’s WILD that you say you’ve gotten back to being “close friends.”~~ This is not your friend. She’s trying to ruin your marriage, intentionally sabotaged a young colleague JUST so she could stay closer to you, and, at best, doesn’t care if she ruins your career. The ONLY interactions you should be having with her are polite work related conversation - at work. If she tries to engage outside of that, you politely tell her you’re not comfortable being alone with her, and do NOT answer when she inevitably argues/cries/acts shocked and hurt. (Mary is more of an AH, but that’s kind of beside the point.)

I think your wife is completely right about drawing a line at travel. I also agree that you should resign if this isn’t respected. And whether you end up leaving or not, you need to file a full report to HR about what brought you to this point. With EVERYTHING that’s happened.

Mary lied to your wife, Mary won’t quit harassing you on work trips to have a drink or dinner with her after you’ve repeatedly declined (sexual harassment goes both ways and if this was a man harassing a female co worker and making up lies etc this wouldn’t even be up for debate). It’s time to go lay it all out for HR. How Mary has been behaving, how she behaved before, how you suspect she has developed very inappropriate feelings for you, how she is intentionally lying to your wife to cause issues not only in your personal life but marriage as well, how you strongly suspect she lied about Caroline ruining not only her personal relationship but also her job and reputation and you feel she is doing the same to you. 

Then mention a few trigger words like sexual harassment, lawyer, defamation, getting to the bottom of who started the rumors about you and Caroline, who sent the false information to her boyfriend, maybe you and Caroline should see a lawyer together etc. HR really gets jittery when you start wanting to look into the legal side of things happening at work and if half of what you say is true then you and Caroline have a pretty good case against Mary and the company, the only missing piece would be getting the ex to tell you who told him and perhaps if a lawyer spoke to him and make it clear it was made up and you’re both taking legal action he’d be willing to give up his source. 

Basically dude you’ve been taking this laying down for way to long and letting Mary get away with way to much which is making her brave enough to push it further and further. Now YOU have to take action and correct this for everyone."

When Mary said this, why didn't you immediately correct her? Now the entire group that was there believes \[to some extent\] that you and Mary are playing house. 

If you want your career to remain stable/good, you'd better find a different hotel to stay in when you travel out of town for work. Make your own arrangements for meals. Stop playing 'protector' for Mary. Talk to Mary only when it's necessary for work. This is turning into a major $hit$how for your wife and your career.   

Just do your job, stay at a different hotel, leave the location tracking app on your phone  and go home to your wife.

She's in love with you, and wants to be your wife. She also thinks the only thing stopping it from happening is your wife.

Mary may be AH but you are making her easy.
1. Cut interaction to just profesional exchange, all of it, no drink in the bar, no breakfast, no nothing.
2. Inform your supervisor about the situation like NOW, explain your situation, and put it like what it is harassment, this girl is interested in you and already ruined someone else life, if you don't stop her you are the next.
3. Start exploring your opitions, if you are not heard by your supervisor you need to find something else.

I recommend that every time Mary makes a inappropriate comment like that, you ridicule her for it. 
Her: He was so kind, but nothing else happened
You: Yeah and you should not put yourself in that kind of risk, is not professional and you can not expect from me to be behind you to pick you up

She has sexually harassed you and made it an unsafe work environment, add to that she definitely frames it to your coworkers that you and mary are in a romantic relationship because she constantly points out she knows you more intimately than your actual wife. She also went up to your wife and boss's wife and said you go and take her to her room and stay there til she's asleep, leaving it to the person to imagine you fucked her and left once she dozed off. This has been going on for a long ass time and you have done fuck all. Stop traveling with this woman. Tell hr and your boss if they continue you will hire a lawyer about the sexual harassment that they continue to ignore. Your entire work force thinks you are having an affair with mary.

If though it will suck, maybe look at leaving this toxic work environment. Mary seems like she wants to herself and is willing to do a lot to get that accomplished. It would be more expensive and loss of money if you got divorced with Brooke. Maybe suggest selling the house and find an apartment/house that’s cheaper while you get a new job or settle for something that pays less while looking for something that’s better? Or would you guys be willing to move cities/states (if the USA)/ provinces? Is sticking it out worth your marriage?

Your job can’t be so important, and having Mary dictating your role in her life is gonna make your life even worse. So my proposal to OP: 

1. Find another job 
2. Request another coworker 
3. (and this is the most risky with the highest reward):
Trap Mary in her own game. 
You get another phone, which your wife will use. She will impersonate you and text Mary that you and your wife are getting a divorce. You will request sick leave from work. Then she will probably lower her guard and will think that you are vulnerable enough to text something dirty. You will use the text and sue the company for sexual harassment unless they fire Mary. Problem solved. But this is a job for your wife, not you. Because you are gonna definitely mess this up and create even more problems"

Question for me is why do you have ANY interactions with Mary outside work related things, there should be NO dinners, NO coffee/drinks at cafes etc. She gets drunk, that’s her problem because you won’t be around to stop/witness it anyway. 

All communication about work should be done through email (with yourself BCC so the company can see if she manipulates the emails if ever needed), wanna coordinate the days work assignments, send an email after reaching your room after work to communicate next days assignments.

And it would also colour me surprised if the picture thing didn’t happen just after a trip with Mary, before the next trip with you, meaning if Carolina took the pictures on a trip with Mary, you would only have access if she herself sent them to you, and you said they went through your phone and obviously didn’t fine anything. (Because if it isn’t Mary, it’s Carolina’s BF own friends since there would logically only be 2 phones those pictures were on)

Also I would go to HR again with your managers wife as a mentioned witness to Mary making up lies, since you and your wife for a fact know you were on the phone together when you were on your way to your own room after dropping Mary of at her door, and now she is involving management in the untruths.

Also I would put the mic recording app on your lock screen for quick undetected access and record all “extra” talks Mary seeks out with you, if you don’t feel safe. 

Ask of there isn’t a man you could travel with instead, if they needed to train an extra before, get a male coworker next time. 

I get where your wife is coming from, because she sees that Mary doesn’t care if she ruins your career as long as she gets to live in her delusional world. And that is just a time 💣waiting to go of when she wants more attention next time. But when will that be? In 2 months or in 3 years.

Keep applying for new jobs even just one step back seems to be better than Mary in the shadows!"

OP is a wuss. 100% agree about never accommodating in any way her drinking. If she gets hammered, that's on her. Don't accompany her to a bar, leave as soon as you're done eating (do not stay at the table while she drinks). 

Tell her, explicitly, in an email, blind copied to your wife so you and your wife have copies, that if she drinks on the road, you will not, under any circumstances, enable it. You won't come get her at a bar. You won't take her to her room.

WHAT!!! ABSOLUTE.....WHAT?!?!?!

F'K NO!!  

After work I'd be back in my room so fast, not a word or a glance towards this woman, I might say ""see you at work in the morning"" or something to indicate we are not spending time together. 

But I would 100% eat alone in my room, no dinners, no attending anywhere that sells alcohol, even the hotel bar with her. I'd do everything I could to actively avoid her at every opportunity. I'd keep food like fruit, apples, bananas, some soda/ drinks and chips/biscuits in my room for snacking. 

I would be recording secretly every conversation or time I felt we could be alone for my own sake. If that meant we had to share a ride in a company car from work to a hotel, I'd be recording for 10 mins before we left the office until i got back to my hotel room. Even if nothing happened, I'd keep it for myself to show nothing happened. 

If she asked to have dinner I'd say I was eating alone in my room. Could be true, could be a lie. I'd ask for hotel bookings made by the company to locate us on different floors or wings of a hotel if possible. Then just go out in the evening on my own, if that meant a store/Walmart or restaurant on my own, so be it. 

If she was standing beside me at check-in to a hotel and knew my room, I'd wait til she'd left then immediately swap rooms with the hotel if possible. 

I would put every road block in the way to stop from interacting with her in any basic human level, never mind socially. Professionally, fine, at work, we do our jobs. And when we're off the clock....nothing. 

I can't believe OP, however nice, kind, gentlemanly or whatever would allow themselves to be put even in the perception of a situation to be twisted as she did. And she already burned him and the coworker. To be around her when she's making obvious bad decisions and trying to influence my behaviour, for a meal, for a chat, for a drink....nothing."

She refuses to leave you alone and also harassed you in front of your wife at a business party. If she's getting drunk at work functions, record her behavior. DO NOT take her to her room or even talk to her. NTA"

He should communicate openly with HR and send a confidential email detailing everything that happened, including how it’s affecting his marriage (due to Mary’s comments and overstepping his boundaries ).

First of all, he isn't responsible to get Mary to her room.  Let her reap the consequences for HER actions.

Second, should he report this drinking behavior to work?  Surely her drunken behavior is not a good look for the company she represents. If this is recurring behavior, you sure would think the company would have issue with it."

Yeahhhhh, I’m wondering why OP is expected to tolerate an unhinged woman who is in love with a married man and causing problems in his home life with her blatant lies (and implied threat of getting people fired with her jealousy and possessiveness over OP). 

“Escalate this before it escalates you” — good advice. OP, you in danger! Run, don’t walk, to the scheduler of these partnerings, boss, and HR. Tell them that starting fights with your wife with her line-crossing obsession is unacceptable and terrifying, and illegal to continue insisting you work only with her. Document everything. These are fireable offenses. I’d start your own subtle campaign of verifying with coworkers whether she was telling everyone you were Loverboy for further documentation. 
Avoid the most malicious gossips, who are likely to be fueling her gossip and jealous office campaigns. 

I bet a lot of people are aware of her behavior, which is why no one wants to work with her — yet, SOMEONE is helping pass this all around. So be careful. 
Or, I mean, you could go full scorched-earth letting everyone know what kind of person she is / what she’s done / denying her rumors while pointing out her obvious obsession with you, purposely not being careful. I don’t know, I tend to mix tactics depending on my audience and who I can trust vs not, or whether I do or don’t care what specific people think.

Finally…every time she speaks to or about you or wifay or past trips, shut it down immediately. Call her out for lying right in front of everyone and state to leave you alone. State that she drinks heavily and crosses your boundaries on every trip. Walk away if you have to. Grey rock her otherwise."

OP, its time to go back to HR about Mary. Never again go to a bar or restaurant with Mary. Heck I'm not sure sharing an uber is safe because she is just that devious. If she gets drunk, do not respond to her calls or texts about escorting her to her room. If you feel the need to respond, respond with ""Mary, you will need to call security to escort you. I'm not available."" No more. Screenshot. Facetime your wife or friend so you have corroborating evidence you were no where near her. She is crazy. 

She will twist ANY interaction.

I would call HR and ask to have a meeting with your manager and HR together about Mary's behavior at the party - provide the time stamps. It's time to take action swiftly. She is a serious danger to you professionally."

OP wasn’t a part of that conversation, he only heard about it after; the only way to refute it is by bringing it up himself a day later, to someone who wasn’t even there — and however serious his concerns really are, a complaint that starts with “My wife told me that Mary told your wife _____” just sounds like childish drama.

OP is in a lose—lose situation as long as he works with Mary. If he goes to HR over every single thing while Mary does not, then HR will see OP as the threat to the company (as someone more likely to bring sexual harassment charges etc), and they may look for any excuse to let him go. If he doesn’t speak up, Mary’s rumor-spreading goes unchecked. But I also think his wife is right to worry that if OP upsets Mary with too many rejections, Mary may frame him just like she framed Carolina — so stopping the dinners together could be a risk. I agree with another commenter, OP should speak to HR and management about being placed in a different hotel from Mary for any future travel; it would make it easier to avoid her without her taking it personally, and give her limited opportunity to try to frame him. Then add some location tracking so he can always prove he was not at her hotel if needed. Hopefully the company will replace Carolina, but it doesn’t seem like anyone but OP sees Mary as a real threat yet."

I think after his last update, with Mary hacking into Carolina’s phone, someone suggested that it was fake because “How!?” and also why is the company still sending them together, surely if Mary does say he assaulted her it can also be used against the company because they kept putting them together …?

> She felt that as we have known each other more time than I have been married, she knows me more intimately than even my wife (I have no idea why she feels that way) and I also behave like her husband when we travel together. She went on about how we go out to dinners together after work, how I always insist on having breakfast together in morning (to plan our actions of the day), and I walk around in my underwear (referring to my gym shorts) around her in mornings. She also talked about how we spend hours talking to each other during road trips and how I am the only man she can trust with any secret in her life.

shortly followed by:

> As expected, my wife was angry at Mary and told me that she hates the term work-husband. She asked me if Mary has ever flirted with me during our trips or has a crush on me. I truthfully told her that I really have not felt that way and she may have just said that because she was a bit drunk and is now being stubborn about it.

I feel like OP is waiting for this woman to try something more serious for him to react, but when that happens it will be too late. hahaha me being a woman I recognize that in this world there are bad women and that is one of them. She wants to succeed in sowing a seed of doubt towards OP’s wife little by little and it seems she is succeeding. In the future the wife will ask for a divorce since OP is not respecting the boundaries with the coworker."

I'm a woman, and I'm aware that it can be difficult to report sexual harassment when there's not a provable 'specific thing/s' or 'moment/s'. The creeps who walk the borderline are the hardest to pin down, and when they're acting smart/sneaky in their work, like it seems like Mary is, it is even harder.

Men tend to be believed less as well. 

I think this has now reached the point that there's enough 'Hmmm...' things that OP could fairly confidently go to HR and ask them to investigate. Finding out who folks heard rumours through and having proof that Mary lied about OP's actions in front of work-related people would be enough to tip this over."

I half chuckled at this because I remember (many moons ago) when I was seeing a guy who lived a couple of hours away from me...he called me to tell me his friend's wife's car was having some issue at the same store he was at and that he was giving her a ride to their house. 

I'd never met the friends before, but the names were familiar and the story was believable. 

I pretty much was like ""okay babe, cool""...and he didn't hang up lol. When he dropped her off he was like ""I wanted you to be on the phone the whole time so nothing could be said""

3) Stay at the party; don't leave as it might signal retreat. If anything is said about the event, only reply that: ""I have turned the matter over to HR and something will change.""

4) Write the email the next morning. Be as specific as possible. Include dates and names of those present when events occurred. As for the hotel incident, contact the hotel and ask if they have camera footage of her drunknees and anything in the hallways to show you didn't enter her room.

Why would OOP do this? 

Honestly, I feel like this story is made-up. It seems strange to me that so many people would share the exact same opinion on the phrases 'work-husband' and 'work-wife.' True or not, Mary meant the phrase in a way that it's not meant to be used, and OOP and his wife interpreted it the exact same way? There was no discussion about it, just a lot of rage? 

Here's why this story bothers me: OOP is basically the male Helen of Troy. His co-worker cannot contain herself, even though she's been working in an office environment for at least six years, and all six as OOP's co-worker. Now, out of nowhere, she's fighting other co-workers and OOP's own wife, insisting that she knows him better than anyone else? OOP says that Mary doesn't understand the difference between gym shorts and underwear. I don't understand why he's having any conversations with his co-worker while he's in gym shorts, and not in the gym. 

OOP's wife is enraged that any woman would dare claim OOP as her own, ignoring the 'work' part of that phrase. Despite the fact that they had multiple conversations about Mary being just shy of axe-crazy, Brooke is still furious with OOP for being considerate and getting his wacky drunk co-worker to her room, even with all of the texting that OOP did to prove his innocence. So she can't control herself and use her brain all of a sudden, either. 

And Carolina was only working with OOP and minding her own business, but she got fired because they were in his office with the door shut? What's the point of an office door, then? 

It just comes across like OOP thinks he's a heroic god and every woman he knows is a psycho.

Edit: Also, after all of the issues that OOP had with Mary before he started working with Carolina, what HR department would ever approve of Mary working with him again? Why did OOP agree to it? It makes no sense."

Once they were done with their meetings, OOP had no obligations to share meals/time with Mary. If anything, he could always opt for room service because he has work to catch up on. Also Mary bragging to their manager’s wife that she got so wasted on a work trip that OoP had to help her to her room is such an odd flex for her to make. If anything, OOP should get their accounting to do a thorough audit of Mary’s travel expenses because I’m sure there’s some language somewhere about what are acceptable expenses the per diems would cover, as well as behavior while representing the company. 

I have a friend through work who had a ‘friend’ like Mary (i do not know that woman because she is part of a separate friend group with my friend, but know of her because she and I unfortunately share the same name, which has caused confusion in the past with his now-wife.) He and his now-wife are college sweethearts, but met their Mary in their old apartment complex, where they had a large friend group that would hang out and party together. 

This Mary evidently is a huge ‘pick me’ and would try and hook up with all the guys in the group, and because my friend was steadfastly in a relationship, he became the main target of her attention. It did not help that due to his partner’s work schedule, she didn’t go out on the town with the group as often. Their Mary would pull the same sh!t as this Mary, where she would always get wasted enough so he (younger brother of sisters) would feel responsible for getting her back home. It got to the point where he would be out without Mary and she would still call or text him ‘wasted’ so he could come to her rescue. She would also send semi-racy texts to him asking for advice for what to wear for dates. To my friend’s credit, he always shared the messages and the stupid antics Mary tried to pull with his partner, but same as Brooke, her patience with ‘Mary’ also wore thin. 

I told him many times that he needed to let Mary deal with her own consequences and not rely on him for rescuing, and cut her off, it wasn’t worth the strain on his relationship with his partner, or potentially giving ‘Mary’ any opportunities to create more wedges between him and his partner. Unsurprisingly, after he did cut her off, she would still occasionally stalk him and ‘coincidentally’ show up at the same bar he was at if his friends happened to geotag him on social media, to the point he had to tell his friends to never post pics of him with them until *after* several days. Thankfully he and his wife moved to the suburbs and away from any more drama from their personal Mary stalker."

He has gotten good advice but seems weirdly resistant to putting reasonable safety measures in place.  I think he probably was so much more unprofessional than Reddit assumed.  

If it was normal for him to eat dinner out every evening and then stay and get drunk at the hotel bar every night on work trips with her after spending hours traveling in a car together I can see how he thinks just not drinking is putting up barriers. But he is still spending every evening with her which is wildly inappropriate at this point. But sure- well done! You only drink occasionally on your dates with your coworkers! 

He should not be spending any extra time with her at all.  Stop traveling together! No dinners out unless a client is with them.  No joint breakfasts.  Definitely don’t accompany her to her hotel room when she is drunk.  Location tracking doesn’t stop an affair if you are staying at the same hotel! No wonder his wife is pissed.

I'm glad he's at least taking some of the advice like going to HR, but as soon as she called him ""work husband"" he should have been running there. The fact that he continued to spend time with her, drink with her, and walk her to her hotel room after what she did to Carolina is just....not smart. 


It makes me think of this other story I saw recently where a guy got an accidental nude over text from a woman he worked with, and even though she immediately apologized and it seemed like it was a mistake and not meant for him, he still went to HR, and it was all handled very well. Intentional harassment and assault by someone who will lie and manipulate everyone around them is going to ofc be much more difficult to handle than that other story where it was an accident, but taking the steps to handle it correctly is going to go over better than doing nothing and hoping it magically goes away. "

This is nonsense. 

She most likely believed the coworker because OP has put zero boundaries in place, continues to go to meals with the coworker, and is doing nothing about the coworker.

This is just victim blaming and a really fucked up thing to say. He is clearly not good at setting boundaries, and it's fine to criticize him for that, there's a lot of things he did here that were not great, but don't say that he likes being sexually harassed.


Right now he's planning on going to HR and his plan is to quit if they won't seperate Mary from him. And he wouldn't even be the first person who quit because of her if he does. 


Mary convinced everyone else in their office that he and Carolina were sexually involved, and alienated both of them from everyone else so that she could continue to have access to op. In case you didn't notice Carolina quit and op is planning on quitting as well. She lied to his wife and bosses saying he did things that he didn't do. She is trying to destroy his marriage and get him fired. She's already managed to ruin his reputation at work. 


Just because op isn't prepared or able to handle sexually harassment and a crazy manipuatlvie person trying to sabatoge and destroy his entire life well enough to your standards does not make it okay to say such a disgusting thing and accuse him of ""liking"" being put through this. "

Could he be doing more to gray rock Mary outside of what is needed to do his job? Sure, but he did other things that he and his wife agreed on, like not drinking, using a location app, and calling her every night when he gets back to his room. And then of course there is the original post where all this started that led to him putting stuff on the record with HR and getting paired with Carolina for trips. So claiming that he's done nothing is factually wrong.



His wife has no reason to believe Mary over OOP when she knows Mary has been manipulative and *suspected herself* that Mary concocted the situation that led to Carolina's HR investigation and resignation. Why was her first reaction not ""I should ask OOP what happened""? If I were OOP I would be furious that my spouse jumped straight to victim blaming and didn't stop for one second to figure out the truth."

Who cares if they didn’t get physical with her? Abuse is abuse, period, and that is exactly what this is. They literally drove this girl to try and take her own life. 

I can’t imagine how hard it would be to lose a sibling in an accident, let alone be there for it, imagine the survivor’s guilt OOP has, and to make everything worse, it was her own twin. They came into this world together, they were never apart since birth, they always had each other, and now one of them is gone and the other has to live with it while living in the same house as the one directly responsible for it while said person refuses to take any accountability whatsoever. 

1) Stepmom was very much responsible for the death of OOP’s twin sister. Even the court agreed with OOP and put her on probation for it. 

2) Stepmom refuses to apologize, try to make amends with OOP, or take any responsibility whatsoever for the death of OOP’s twin sister. 

3) Stepmom is clearly trying to erase the memory of this girl’s dead sister, as if she never even existed in the first place and was nothing but an inconvenience to her. She said she could build an even stronger bond with the baby, as if her baby was better than OOP’s late sister, somehow more worthy of her love and respect, and she’s already redecorating this girl’s room and turning it into her baby girl’s nursery without at the very least bringing it up with OOP first, who visits said room quite often. She also interrupted the father when he said they had *four* kids to correct him and say that, no, they didn’t have *four* kids, they actually had *three* kids (what was even the point of doing this if not to be petty, vindictive and just generally disrespectful?). 

4) Stepmom alienated her from her own baby brothers and attempted to turn them against her. 

5) They outright blamed OOP, the suicidal, depressed child who just lost her twin sister, for stepmom’s miscarriage even though stepmom has a long history of infertility issues, failed pregnancies and previous miscarriages in the past. Who in the world would have seen that coming, I wonder? 

6) They grounded OOP as punishment for her depression and attempt to take her own life. 

7) They refused to let OOP speak to her own mother and deliberately isolated her from her friends and loved ones after very well nearly dying. 

8) They invaded OOP’s privacy and deliberately sought to humiliate her by reading her diary aloud, rather than simply asking her how she felt and trying to have an honest sit down conversation with her, refused to let her shower and use the bathroom by herself in private, rather than simply taking any sharp objects and potentially harmful objects and substances out of the bathroom, and then took her door away, leaving her feeling even more naked and vulnerable. Maybe she was on suicide watch, but this is NOT how you save this kid, no, this is how you only make things worse. 

9) They refused to let her see a therapist after the car accident and the death of her twin sister, even after her honest-to-god suicide attempt, and her father even protested against the psychiatric help she received after the fact. 

10) Stepmom clearly didn’t care for these girls and is now looking for any excuse she can to send the other twin away. She’s downright happy this girl is no longer in HER house and she has made it more than clear she sees HERSELF as the head of this household. 

Literally every decision they made here was the wrong one and I have no clue how these two imbeciles could possibly fuck things up so much. It’s like they genuinely wanted to hurt her! And they probably did. May the devil take them both!"

He doesn't have to have a breakdown or anything, but it felt like he didn't even care, whereas OOP's mom did.

Then again, what morality can you expect from a woman who'd cheat with a married man."

I’ve dealt with it, and heard lots of kids experience similar things in group therapy sessions. I was getting upset reading this story because it was EXACTLY what my mom and stepdad did to me.

Took away all electronics, threw most of my belongings in storage except a handful of books and outfits for school, put my bed right in front of my door and then took my door. I told my psychiatrist about it, and he seemed surprised. He asked to talk to my mom so I sent her in, and 5 minutes later we were leaving and I never saw him again. She said she hated him because “he clearly doesn’t know how to be a parent in these situations” and didn’t want him to “inflate my ego thinking I was right.”

Parents take suicidal thoughts/actions as personal attacks.  It’s a dirty secret that god forbid get out, or questions might come. They’ll just punish the kid to stay silent, and be all shocked pikachu when another attempt happens.

I did end up getting kicked out for “bringing tension into the house” and had to move in with my physically abusive father so, yeah."

I had an abusive mother and an absent father, and I never hated him like I hated her, because she tormented me every day and he just wasn't there. Once I got out on my own and put a little distance between myself and the whole situation, I came to realize that as bad as she was, he had wronged me more deeply.

I'm sure her mother had her reasons, just as my father had his reasons. The fact remains that they abandoned their children, and no reason is really adequate."

What her mother tried to do was something no reasonable judge would allow . The father was not nmentioned to be in any way abusive or otherwise unfit as a parent . What the mother went to petition the court for was the (practically ) permanent removal of the children ,that were too young to have an opinion , from the care of a fit and willing father . She pretty much asked to be given the right to have not just full , but also absolute custody . If the court had accepted that , she would have been able to take the children from the only place they had known as a home , moved to a completely different continent and only allowed whatever access she wanted to their father . Meanwhile , the court would have looked at her decision to immigrate as nothing more than a personal choice ( would she had even  made the same choice if the cheating hadnt happened and she was still married to the father ?) . After that , the father had full custody by default , because she practically decided to only be a part of her children's lives from a distance . This wasn't a 'the rich win and the poor lose "" . This most likely was a ""the reasonable side wins "" situation..."

I finally told my stepmother about it when the depression became unbearable.  That night, she and my dad yelled at me and told me I'd never see my birth mother in heaven if I committed suicide.

That sweater was tainted for me afterwards.

I don't understand how any human could react that way.

I understand step mom not wanting to blame herself and *needing* to have her step kids death be an accident. I understand OP needing to blame someone, and that the step mom who caused the accident and likely had some prior issues with being a good target for the anger around her sister death. I understand those things being a huge conflict. I don't understand responding by being insensitive about the dead sister's things, and not heavily involving your grieving kids in the process. It also sounds like a huge mistake to tie the nursery prep to losing yet another part of a forever gone sibling. Losing yet another wanted kid after multiple miscarriages has to be terrible, but blaming your teen that lost thier twin tramatically isn't the way to handle that. If this wasn't the first miscarriage, and was planned, the parents could have easily talked to the kids about plans for the twins bedroom week ahead of time.

I'm so glad OP got away. I hope there's some level of repairing the alienation with younger siblings that will happen, and that space allows her and the stepmom to heal from more trama than a family should go through.

I also feel really bad for the brother that went through losing a sibling and being in the middle of this step mother and remaining sister fight where nobody's probably dealing with grief, the things that have to have gone on during previous miscarriages, and then to find his sister dieing? That's fucking tramatizing. Then to see OP's mental health issues have her be involuntarily held followed by the parents handling everything in the worst ways possible- that brother is going to be worse off for handling any mental issues from everything. The brothers aren't mentioned as a half so that maybe went through the affair and divorce too? That's so much for a kid."

One thing I find often is that people have kids because that's what you do, you graduate, get a job, get married, have kids. And people do this without thought that they are bring another whole human into the world. Oft times people have a vision of what their kids will be like, and they love the child in that vision. That child will never have a snotty nose, or talk back, often that child will be an exact clone, or make up where the parent failed in there own life. That child is perfect and wonderful and is loved.

That is not the child they get though. The child they get is a child. An actual human being, not a toy or a pet or second chance clone. The child had their own issues and bad days and cannot possibly live up to the standard their parents created.

To the parent they did try their best. They tried their best to make them this human fit into a doll mold that they created that the human just doesn't fit into - square peg into a round hole. Then the child becomes a problem child. Nothing is good enough, because the child is not good enough, they do not fit. So the parent, instead of learning what they child does like, what they are good at, and where they can help the child thrive, opts for punishment. You do not make us happy so you are not allowed to be happy. They lose everything, all privileges, all possessions, all semblance of anything that could allow them to have personhood - the beatings will continue until morale improves-.

Now nobody is happy. The parents did not get the child they wanted, the child cannot be what the parents wanted. The child acts out because why wouldn't they, they can't meet expectations so why even bother trying, they are going to get punished either way, so it doesn't matter. And if they don't act out, they act in, self harm, eating disorders, anxiety, suicide. These are cries for help, but all the parents see is more misbehaving and attention seeking (an unworthy children seeking attention is a child that does not their place) And sometimes it's a mix of both. Either way the parents go back to what they know - punishment. 

And the cycle continues."

Telling the judge 'so we tried this custody arrangement and now my sister is dead. This environment is not beneficial to my safety or wellbeing and I'd like to try living with my mom' may have gotten her out. 

I doubt a custody judge would be enthused to realize one of the twins died in their current custody arrangement, in a situation where the driver of the vehicle was the stepmother and it sounds like she was at fault.

The strictest and the prosperity gospel ones are absolutely flourishing. Powerful men love the strict ones, because it gives them control over their family and community, while other people join to get jobs, connections and promotions. Prosperity gospel is fuelled by the Asian community where jesus has replaced the Chinese God of wealth effectively.

Your saner, regular churches are in famine mode, because a lot of them choose to follow the gospels the correct way. There's no reward promised for going, no power, no prosperity, only endless duty to mankind and poverty everywhere. Those are the churches dying out.

Scum floats to the top.

Edit: for those wondering how these powerful men can get away with blue murder, say they committed a terrible sin, cheated on their wife with an underage girl in the congregation, then ran over her dad after being confronted. What the pastors will quote are from 2 directions: david and moses. He'll still be prosperous, so the pastor will say david committed a serous sin (banged his general's wife and then killed him), but god forgave him and even made him the greatest of god's chosen, so who are you a sinner, to cast judgement. Plus, he's not obliged to even apologise, because many verses in the bible, especially the old testament only talks about asking forgiveness from God, not the victim. The second angle they'll talk about is Moses, where the earth swallowed up to consume rebels after they rebelled (very justifiably, he was more lost than a 2nd lieutenant on his first day - took 40 years to complete a 1 month journey), so if you continue resisting his yoke, God will personally come down and kill your ass. Who are you a sinner to question who God selects as his leader.

The long and short of it is the abrahamic religions are extremely twisted. Yahweh was part of a canaanite pantheon as a canaanite storm God who craved for child sacrifice, which is how you got the binding of issac. Then when canaanites were exiled to Babylon, those of the cult of Yahweh created their own version of Yahweh supremacy, which is why there's so many contradictions in gods holy book. Because God said so is the message of their book, don't question, because doubters go straight to hell."

Sure there are people who use Christianity to hide and do evil things. But that is not the case EVERY single time you see news of a Christian doing a bad thing. Saying that Christians can do no wrong goes directly against the doctrine Christianity teaches. There are bad Christians, deal with it."

Jephthah presents a problem that comes from the Hebrew Bible being compiled and redacted for a thousand years. You go from a society where human sacrifice was probably sometimes performed, to one in which it's forbidden as something God detests.

There's not really a good answer provided by [the text itself.](https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.11.30?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=all) It's usually interpreted as meaning either Jephthah's daughter was ""sacrificed"" in that she had to remain a virgin, or Jephthah killed her but God didn't want him to (and Jephthah did it because he was an evil man).

As for Yahweh loving human sacrifice: it sounds like you're assuming a continuity and coherence in his character, that doesn't exist. Per Wikipedia, Yahweh started being worshiped in about 1550 BCE. The Septuagint (a Greek-language version of Old Testament) is from the third century BCE. That's more than a *thousand years* of cultural change affecting who and what Yahweh is. (Edit: These changes include Yahweh and El becoming the same god, and Yahweh/El becoming the only God who's ever existed.)"

Actual historians trace the history of the bible to canaanite exiles of the cult of Yahweh in Babylon.

Also, jephthah explicitly said he will offer as a burnt sacrifice, whoever came to greet him, so could be a slave, could be a wife, a son a daughter, just a delicious human for the bloodthirsty Yahweh. All that wondering if it was if she was unmarried, remained a virgin, or he did it and was a bad man are fluff added by pastors to make such a reprehensible deed more palatable.

What's clear is Yahweh craves and loves human sacrifice, why else would he say something like that if Yahweh didn't? Also, who are you to condemn him as an evil man for doing so, he was literally, explicitly gods chosen representative on this world, and even God forgave king David, and made him most exalted. If you're not careful, the earth will open up and swallow you, just like it did for the rebels against Moses. I'd recommend human sacrifice as repentance.

PS, Yahweh is formless, but golden bulls are his foot stool. Aaron built one, but he was a bad guy, so whatever, but Jeroboam also built them as an alternate worship site to Yahweh, and nothing further was written about the specific deed itself."

I was just explaining how people interpret the Jephthah thing to make it jibe with God hating human sacrifice elsewhere. (Although ironically, Christians believe God's plan for salvation revolves around a human sacrifice.)

The Bible is completely inconsistent because it's an anthology of texts. For some reason, the redactors were ok with this — they could have made it consistent, but chose not to. Because they had a completely different set of standards for what makes a text sensible and authoritative. That's why we can't really understand huge chunks of the Bible. 

I think our best bet against fundamentalism is to look at what the Bible actually says and put it in its historical context. (And yeah, I fucked up by saying the story of Isaac is against human sacrifice. I misremembered it.) Biblical literalists straight up lie all the time. They make intentionally incorrect translations like the NIV. Calling their bluff is more persuasive than being an edgelord."

You try to help her, but as you said you hit a stalemate, after she kept deleting the address. If you keep trying to help her & she still deletes address, you’ll be there for ages. You have your child with you & you can’t stop what you doing, for too long. 

But I have a feeling she might be trying to con you into giving her a lift & maybe mug you. When I was on a business trip last month, staff at hotel told guests about a con going on in the area. This what they said-
While a person is getting into their car, they get approached by someone, that is having problems getting home, because issues with Uber/taxi/bus or they have no money. So car owner would offer them a lift, but instead of going to a house, they are lead to a trap. The approacher would hold a weapon to car owner head/neck & the others (with the approacher) will jump out from where they are hiding. Car owner gotten their car & other belongings stolen. Staff said it happened to 3 people in the area."

That’s a dangerous situation. In the front seat or back seat the driver is at a disadvantage if attacked by a passenger. You also would be going to a secondary, also unknown, location. You don’t know who’s there and you don’t know this person nor what is on their person, like weapons. I may have called police non emergency to be safe, but I wouldn’t have given a ride either, especially with your son involved. It’s unfortunate, maybe if she gave you cash you could order the Uber, maybe call a taxi for her or non emergency, but there’s nothing you can do without taking on a potentially serious risk. There are a lot of human traffickers as well as just dangerous people who target people, like a lone woman with a child, through emotional manipulation. Pregnant women will strike an emotional cord for mothers specifically. I get we want to see the best in people, but where safety of you and your child are concerned, it’s not worth the risk. No one thinks it will happen to them until it’s too late."

I can sometimes be over cautious with people especially since  having my son, but this eases my mind that I made the right choice. One thing to clarify is she definitely was pregnant because of the after visit paper work I saw in her hand while typing in her phone (I did snoop to check since I felt off when she approached me). Since that was clear, I was more akin to help her than I might with other people. However, that’s not to say pregnant people can’t be involved in some shady things as well.

Edit to add:

For those mentioning Google translate or language apps: I agree wholeheartedly and have had to use them upon occasion with my husband’s family when I don’t know how to say something in Spanish. This interaction was probably 3-4 minutes so I think it could have gotten to that point but 1.  I didn’t really care that much in this case if that makes sense since it wasn’t really my problem. If I needed help I would use the translation app but I feel like it’s more on the person who needs the help to initiate that. 2. I was keeping my hands clear just in case something happened so I wasn’t going to bring my phone into the mix. 3. The woman did seem genuinely overwhelmed and worried. She was pregnant according to her doctor summary in her hand, she was trying to communicate with the Uber driver, texting with someone maybe asking for help, trying to interact with me, the parking lot was clearing out and it was getting close to nighttime. Thus, I think all those factors made it where that wasn’t something we did in that moment."

Something similar happened to me but on a train a good long while ago.

I (at the time 18 or so) was waiting to arrive at my station after an afternoon in a larger city around my area. This man in his mid-thirties (at least) walks up to me, a lone girl at the opposite side of the train while passing a group of young men and others. He cannot speak the language of my country or English. He leans down to me and presses his phone into my hand and pulled up a translator. He says he wants to get out at station A. We already passed that station so I type in that he should get out at the next station (my station) and wait half an hour till the next train will arrive in the opposite direction. I also told him that he could get help from service on the train about his ticket. 

He does not seem to let it go and keeps repeating the same thing, despite the translator helping him and decides to follow me around when I tell him that I have to go. I immediately feel the hair on my nape stand. 

Anyway, he steps out of the train at the same exit as me and I rush out, he instantly beelines after me so I ask a woman if I can tag along with her because someone is bothering me. The woman nods and we walk off while I watch him over my shoulder. He staggers to a halt when he noted the woman beside me and literally turns around. 

The funny thing is, I don’t know even today if he thought of harming me, probably not, but it’s odd if you cross the whole dang train to a young looking girl to ask her for help when there were literally 20 men around you and around your age that would’ve done the same thing as me.

I was picking up my 2yo son from daycare, which is in a commercial building that also has a doctor’s office. When I was strapping my son in his car seat in the parking lot, a clearly pregnant woman approached me and got quite close to where I was standing (like two feet from my open car door where I was bent over to buckle my son in). She asked for help with her uber and said she doesn’t speak English fluently. I spoke with the uber driver on speaker and he was at another branch of the doctor’s office in another town and he advised us to cancel and book another uber. I offered to do this for her and cancelled her ride and typed the correct address into the app for her, but she kept deleting the address and then handing me the phone again. I told her I was putting the address in correctly for her but she continued to delete the address. I felt like I couldn’t do much more for her at that point and said a few more times she needs to enter the correct address into the app. There was a clear language barrier; I only speak English  and am average at Spanish and her phone had Farsi letters on it which other than recognizing that have no knowledge of. I started to leave and she kept asking me to stay and help her. I told her I needed to get home and that she wasn’t allowing me to help her. She got very snippy towards me as I got in my car and left. I felt bad because she was pregnant and seemed distressed about getting home, but I felt like we were at a stalemate in what I could do for her and I was also uncomfortable with how close she approached me initially, that I was with my young son, and that she kept deleting the address when I typed it in.

I think that because I was walking in the streets recently at 2 am at night. At a bus stop one foreign woman stopped me, speaking broken English (I am in Eastern Europe so it's not my first language either but was still having a hard time understanding). She had a small child, about 4y.o with her and said that they are mother and child, tourists trying to get to an airbnb (fair enough, there are indeed airbnb-s in that area) and that she really needs to use a phone to call the host because she doesn't have the connection. I stupidly handed over my phone because there was a small girl literally at 2am in the street. 

Luckily it seemed a little sus enough that when I went to check what number she was typing in, she was actually on my amazon account, trying to change my e-mail address.  Don't even know what the scam is there but I felt really unsafe afterwards and I didn't before, even though I did before, being a woman walking alone in the streets at night. 😥

I have worked in an OB office in NM There are many refugees who come here and to many other parts of the US ..even ones that speak Farsi through special programs that try to get them work and if they're pregnant get them healthcare for the baby. I had to do an extensive med hx with a refugee and was definitely not able to do that without utilizing some kind of translation app . The true asshole is the doctors office you are never supposed to let a patient not be able to get home that is something every provider and nurse will usually ask how will you get home so they can go ahead and arrange something if possible. Even SW would have vouchers for a cab. Because you dont speak the language you really dont know why she kept erasing the address think its wrong to assume she had bad intentions . I know you were with your kid and i understand you want to be safe but she is in a foreign country pregnant and probably doesnt know anything about living here. You could have done a translation on your phone to better help with communication (like asking why she keeps erasing the address) and you didnt instead of making this a moment to show your son that when people need help its okay to help them you showed that when its too inconvenient to help its okay to leave someone helpless. She is a woman that is pregnant who knows how many sickos would take advantage of this along with a communication barrier.  This whole time your speaking to her in English repeatedly knowing she doesnt speak English? So of course she may get frustrated. Ultimately everyone has a right to do whatever they want i hope that woman is safe and was able to get home. Also SHAME on everyone who said this was probably a scam she didnt ask for money nor a ride from the OP and OP says she had actual doctor documents with her so those who say she may not even be pregnant are wrong  this type of talk just sounds xenophobic im quite surprised how everyone just jumped ln the bandwagon for that.

Just like this post, this person claimed that he didn't speak much English except he did not have a phone. Ironically, he knew enough English to communicate that he could put his destination in on my app. As long as I handed him my phone, he would reimburse me.

I told him no, bid him a good day, and asked him to leave. He tried saying, ""So, you make me walk? Don't you Uber?"" The whole exchange was uncomfortable, my gut feeling was setting off all of the warning bells, and I told him that I couldn't help and pointed towards the exit.

What struck me as odd was not so much that he was a stranger and wanted me to pay for his Uber, it was that *he* wanted to use my phone to type in the address, not tell me that address so I could type it in. Even if it was the second option, I still would not have done it. This gave me the strong impression that he was going to bolt out the door with my phone!

1. You are talking about helping someone in your JOB using a translation app. I am a therapist and have worked with various people who speak languages I don’t, at which point I use our language line to assist. I think what I would do in a planned employment situation is very different than what I would do when a random person approached me. 

2. I never assumed her erasing the address was done with bad intentions. I said it was confusing to me and the overall interaction made me anxious and confused. Others have referenced it could have potentially been a trafficking or scam situation. I have commented several times that’s not how I personally felt about it. 

3. My son is 2 years old. He would never remember or understand what this interaction meant. However, I will be teaching my son both the importance of helping while also keeping himself safe. I did try to help. I also wanted him to be safe. 

4. I am a woman with a young child. That is one of the most vulnerable positions to be in as a woman. I have felt more unsafe as a mom with a kid than I ever did while pregnant. I had to worry not only about myself but my sons being safe, my vehicle, and my belongings. There are many sickos in the world as you said. I don’t believe her intention was bad or harmful, but I can’t also assume she had perfectly pure intentions either and offer my help with no limitations. 

5. I didn’t use my phone to translate because I wanted to keep my hands free in case something happened. She quite literally walked up behind me and was two feet away from me while I was bent over putting my two year old in his car seat. No matter what the intention I was immediately uncomfortable with the situation.  Despite that, I put myself in a safer position by closing and locking my car and then still tried to help her. 

6. I spoke very basic, slow English to her since I don’t speak her language at all. I also spoke with the Uber driver and typed the correct address for her to get another driver. I do feel she has a level of personal responsibility when leaving her home to be able to communicate and translate if needed, whether that be with an app or having someone on standby she could text or call for assistance. You’re putting the personal responsibility on me for another grown adult’s choices. 

7. I do agree that the doctors office could have taken some responsibility but perhaps she was not communicating their needs to them as well? I’m a therapist and we have a language line in our office if needed and they could have best assisted her. They were closed when she sought me for help. 

8. This woman was not in imminent danger or having a medical emergency. I would have called 911 or sought additional help if that was the case. 

9. This is less relevant, but I needed to be home by a certain time to have dinner home before my husband’s overnight shift and allow him to see our son. Again, if there was a true emergency that would have made these details irrelevant and I would have stayed longer but because we weren’t getting anywhere and I was not comfortable I chose to leave. 

I feel you are trying to wrap this situation up into a perfect little bow. This was MINUTES long not hours. I was thinking in the moment while having some anxiety over the situation. It’s so easy in hindsight or if you weren’t there to give such a detailed perfect response but it’s really unrealistic to think this would have all went through my mind."

The clinic she was supposed to go to was the one across town, but she didn't realise this and went to the local branch. Somehow she realised that she needed to get to the branch across town, so typed that into the uber app. Unfortunately she put it into the pick up address instead of the destination address. That's why she kept deleting what you wrote, because she didn't know the difference between the pick-up and destination field.

He punched again. I told him again - I remember being punched (with a hook), but It did not really bother me. Still had him grabbed and pulled him down to my level (he was a head taller than me)

That is one of the most vulnerable positions to be in as a woman. I have felt more unsafe as a mom with a kid than I ever did while pregnant""  ok so you're a therapist which makes this more confusing for me just because you yourself did not feel unsafe while pregnant ( in a country you were born in and speak the same language,) doesn't mean that every woman would feel that way. Did you ever think she felt comfortable approaching you because you're also a mom? If you were a 6ft big burly dude i dont think she would have felt as comfortable asking for help. Regardless of whether or not this was during work hours  i think the whole point is if you dont understand someone you have resources to do so. What did you think this woman would do ? You have a car and could just leave ? She wasnt asking for money it didnt seem like she cared anything about your  child i think she might have been confused about the app thus why i mentioned you could have used a translator app ive used these many times while not being at work.much of what your saying puts blame on this woman who again you say has responsibility to what? If your a refugee you dont get to choose what country you go to you also dont get a say in which town you go to you LITERALLY DONT KNOW THE LANGUAGE OR CULTURE at all meaning if you say you spoke very basic slow English to her that wouldn't matter if she again doesnt know the language the speed at which you speak doesnt matter at that point. You blame this woman again by not at least acknowledging that if you have a patient no matter who they are you are responsible in making sure your patients have a way to get home ive worked in healthcare for 10 years never heard of staff leaving someone who doesnt know English to fend for themselves especially someone pregnant. It sounds like the doc staff didnt care enough to make sure this patient was okay. Since you couldn't understand what she was saying is it really valid to say she wasn't in imminent danger how would you know and what would imminent danger look like to you or a medical emergency (which can happen without blood or broken bones) as well. And it sounds like even if there was imminent danger you would have left anyway. You being a therapist i guess i would have expected more empathy at least in your reasoning but this whole response puts the blame on someone who cant even defend themselves especially when they didn't do anything wrong. I think the real reason you posted on here is because you felt guilty and needed people to exonerate you and validate your feelings so it would get you off the hook for not helping as much i think you hopefully wanted to do. Its okay to have stranger danger but it didnt sound like this woman was a threat  and you painting the picture of her in that way is really sad. You kept mentioning you had to be home to bring dinner and such which your right wasn't relevant and just makes it seem like dinner was more of a priority than having to deal with the inconvenience of helping someone out. Again i hope that woman was able to get to wherever she needed to go safely and that her and her baby are in good health. I hope if your kid ever goes to another country and doesnt know the culture or language that someone will be nice enough to help him when he needs it ."

She could have been pretending to not understand how Uber works and typing in the wrong address so that you'd eventually get frustrated and just offer to drive her to that address, since you already know where she's going.

I highly recommend the book The Gift of Fear by Gavin deBecker. It is incredible, a harsh and painful read at times but so important. I think if you read that book you will KNOW you did the right thing. 

One thing he discusses in the book is how dangerous people approach victims. Getting inappropriately close is a thing, it throws you off guard and can be used to try and establish rapport/intimacy or in this case, a sense of dependency, that she NEEDED your help, and now you're in a shared situation that you have to uncomfortably extricate yourself from. People who do bad things to others are skilled in convincing people to put themselves in unsafe situations in order to avoid feeling rude or unkind. Seeking assistance of some kind is an INCREDIBLY common tactic. 

It's possible this was just a coincidence and she was just a pregnant woman with terrible phone skills and no sense of personal space or boundaries, but it doesn't pass the smell test. It didn't for you and that's why you left. That book will help you understand the subconscious knowledge that is already protecting you from danger."

However, I would think as a soon-to-be mom she would also appreciate that I may have limits of what I was willing to do to help her. 

I also understand many pregnant women feel unsafe for various reasons, but it seems you have more empathy for the other women in this situation and that I should have done whatever possible to have met her needs while potentially compromising my own. I think it’s easy to say you would have felt safe and comfortable in this situation to see it fully through but I was personally uncomfortable from the get go with how close she was to me initially as well as her continuing to delete the address for whatever reason. It’s clear despite your previous response that you do think I’m the AH in this situation which is fine I just don’t agree with your rationale behind it which is why I debated my point. If you’re faced with a similar situation perhaps you will choose differently or perhaps you will also feel nervous as I did.  

As a therapist, I have heard all the worst case scenarios. I did not perceive her as a threat but she also was not receptive to the help I was willing to offer. With my son present I am not willing to risk a “what if”; I am going to keep him safe. If my son wasn’t present and she wasn’t standing directly behind me, perhaps I would have been more inclined to continue to help her. 

If she was trying to get an Uber to go home and had also  just been in a doctors office I think it would indicate that she was not in imminent danger. 

How do you know she is a refugee? There are many reasons people emigrate to this country. That’s a big assumption to make. I know it can be hard to navigate a new country; my husband emigrated from Costa Rica to the US as an adult with no family or friends and spoke limited English. Navigating doctors appointments, employment, etc was a huge struggle for him and he did ask for help. Sometimes people did and sometimes people didn’t. He didn’t feel that people had to help him and appreciated the efforts when they did.

Regardless, I DID have empathy for her and her situation which is why I did attempt to help her. I don’t feel guilty for my actions in this situation. I did feel bad for her and her situation. However, my son’s safety trumped her needs in that moment. You’re entitled to your opinion and I am entitled to mine.

Edit to add:
This thread overall has helped me reflect on this overall and a lot of people mentioned calling the non-emergency line to ensure she got help. I think that is one thing I wished I had done after I was in my car and driving home and something I will keep in mind for anything similar that may happen in the future."

I would completely disregard this commenter OP. They think you should disregard the safety of yourself and your child to help a random stranger, who was not in any danger or experiencing an emergency. Ridiculous. 

If she needed help she should have gone back into the doctors office she just came out of. Do not approach a random woman with a small child bent over trying to put him into a car seat. 

OP had no idea who this person was and she did her best to help her while still staying vigilant. She is not obligated to put herself at risk, or worse her child at risk, to help someone.

How is helping someone compromising your needs? I used refugee as an example to be clear people immigrate here a lot does that not mean that they should not be treated as you would want someone to treat you? Again she didnt know the language so of course im going to be more empathetic towards her. Im glad your husband was able to get help when he needed it but  saying he didnt feel like people HAD to help him has nothing to do with this woman he is also a MAN which is a different situation in itself we both dont know her situation for sure but ultimately she needed help you tried and when it was taking longer than a couple minutes you bailed.  Who's to say she didnt feel nervous or scared asking for help but she needed it so she tried probably for the sake of her baby. I have been in these situations working in the ER and helping people on my way out . I never said you didnt have a right to feel whatever feelings you felt at the time but when reading your responses it seems that the welfare of this woman didnt really matter to you since you didnt really try to understand what she was saying?  Again it doesnt really matter one way or the other and i hope this woman was able to get the help she needed. Im glad you and your child got home safe . I will maintain my opinion and you will have yours .

Some women might freeze, but most moms are not going to just stand there while being held at gunpoint or being intimidated while someone takes their child. 

Think about it---how often do we hear about women luring moms into a false sense of security while a getaway car pulls up and the mom gets a gun pulled on her and goes after her child and gets shot and killed and the child is kidnapped? Seriously. How many cases are like that? Not enough to even sort of be a common scenario.

I started weekly language lessons as soon as I moved here for business. Getting a B1 certificate or any other certificate doesn’t help you make friends. You need to start speaking the language, even if you do it incorrectly. 

After 3 months we were invited to Kaffee & Kuchen by work colleagues and we spoke Denglish. Then it was ski season and we took ski lessons in German. That helped a lot! Take sports classes in German, speak German with the butcher and baker and anyone else. Join a hobby club that interests you (gardening, model trains). Go to every wine and beer fest in your village/neighborhood and speak German with the people at your table. “Stranger-Danger” was correctly identified in a comments above, and it disappears for most Germans once they get a little beer/wine in them. Then share with them your excitement for this new place you live. All Germans like to hear a compliment about their region or country. :-)

If you have young kids, talk to the other parents at the playground and at the school, just chit chat about weather and recommended books or a museum nearby, etc. again, share with them the excitement for this new place you live. Maybe share a cool place that you took your kids recently and they enjoyed it! Get a German friend to record a short children’s book that you and your child can together listen to and follow along every evening. Listen to kids tv with subtitles. The most important thing is to keep talking and listening!"

> become really good at German

Be right back in 2 years then? To become really good you need a lot of time. If you come to German with C1, no problem. 

If you start learning the language when you come here, even if you try hard, you’d need a long time before you can speak (you can pass a B1 test in half a year but it’s not enough to speak good). Even more time if you want to have meaningful conversations with Germans (beyond the everyday topics).

So of course the plan is easy: learn the language, find friends. What should people do while they’re learning the language?"

How to make German friends in Germany - from a German ,YesSirLaughsALot,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1how2es/how_to_make_german_friends_in_germany_from_a/,Any_Solution_4261,"Thanks for the advice, but I can tell you it doesn't help.   
If making friends in a country means you have to first master the language, then avoid other people that you already share a lot with and that are also looking for friends and that are facing the same challenges as you are, that's just a bad idea, as you'll be without friends for a long time. 

What happens is: you come to Germany, Germans aren't interested in a friendship. But other foreigners are interested. You share problems with foreigners, not with Germans, who are used to working with German system. 

You also didn't arrive to Germany because you're totally awestruck with Goethe and Oktoberfest, but because of a job that happened to be in Germany and not somewhere else. You're probably thinking if you should stick around or not, because you can find a job in another country too, maybe one that's more open to foreigners or has lower taxes or has better economy, or all of the above. 

Still German systems thinks that foreigners that arrived are primitives that just climbed out of their mud huts and are crying tears of joy for the chance to walk the streets where Johannes Gutenberg walked and whose primary way of integrating in the society depends on proficiency with German language, not on their skills that they obtained somewhere else and that are lacking in German economy.

End result: Germany is great for people that do not intend to work, but intend to live off the system, while for the people that are highly skilled and earn good salaries, it's not so great at all."

Friendship doesn't require so much work.

That being said, the German people are incredibly kind, accepting, and polite while South Koreans were downright racist, judgemental, and dismissive at times. 

That's why cultures are different everywhere. There is no point in expecting people to be same. German relationships in my experience have been practical/transactional and I kinda expect that from 99% of the local people I meet. I don't find s problem with that to be honest.

You’re not God’s gift on this green earth. This isn’t how people from “normal” cultures make friends, this isn’t normal. 

You guys behave like this with zero introspection, then wonder why foreigners just don’t bother hanging out with you. Hell, you already contradicted yourself in your initial points, how the fuck will an immigrant become fluent in German so that they can engage with you in the first place, if they can’t engage with you to speak German? I know for a fact it isn’t that hard to be a little patient when someone is trying to speak your language. 

Yeah nah, I am happy with my close foreigner friends that I met after they asked me to watch their stuff in the library. It takes 10-15 minutes for people of most cultures on the planet to meet for the first time, and set up a meet for a later date to get to know each other properly. Coincidence, I am sure, but whenever I try to set up appointments with my German friends, I have to do it 1 month prior, and even then, it’s a coin toss. Somehow they always know they’re gonna be busy 1 month in the future, they just can’t find the time, poor them. And no, this isn’t a me issue when my other foreign friends also experience this constantly. You guys behave like you’re better than other people, it’s engrained in the culture and it isn’t a personal failing, but it’s hilarious to me that you can write a 9 point list for becoming friends with Germans without going “yo this is fucking insane” once. 

No, friendships shouldn’t take this much effort. My friendships are easy, because we treat each other as equals. I have lived in 4 countries long term on different continents, in none of them have I ever had to read bullshit like this. Y’all are so full of yourselves, it’s unbelievable."

My advice is to just befriend whoever you vibe with, without caring how allmann this person is. 

If you make friends with foreign born individuals, chances are they will become German citizens in 5 years and complete allmanns in 10. The Späti dude is as German as the average Florian and is more proficient in modern German language, wallah. Germans can be all cute whatever but if that person is putting their trophy friendship on such a high pedestal, it may as well be overpriced, don't fall for this bs.

That will not make the friendship qualitatively better. On the flip side, and contrary to allmann belief, foreign (even US American) friendships are no less profound just because we don't kick it off being impolite toward each other. Just vibe with whoever you vibe in 2025. Be kind and the right people will come to you, no Verein needed.

Also, Germans are not direct. It’s the same lie you tell yourselves about German efficiency and „Deutsche Qualität“. It might‘ve been the case pre World War II but now you’re whining if someone is direct and honest.

The so called directness and being blunt means being straight up rude, and an excuse to be borderline racist if you’re from an older generation. You hate to be on the receiving end.

But yeah, if you love football and beer, then you‘ll make some friends and have to listen to unfunny alman jokes.

Tl;dr: Make friends with people whose roots are in other countries (russians, Turks etc) who are well integrated into the German culture and if there are Germans in these friend groups, you‘ll per chance make friends with Germans automatically.

OP meant well, but the most important part is to learn the language and take part in social activities and just have fun. Trying too hard to make friends will result in no friends, or friends you don’t really wanna keep around you."

But I also find some of the comments here quite special.

A lot of things here are so generalized. 

Of course it's good if you can speak some German, but you usually learn more when you talk to people. And don't just learn German while avoiding other foreigners and being lonely.

For me, for example, English is completely sufficient and if necessary you can quickly search for a translation on Google.  Unfortunately I don't speak any other languages, maybe a little French. I sometimes look for Italian terms to talk to my Italian colleague when we can't think of any German or English words.

Likewise, it wouldn't matter to me whether I went to have a coffee with someone alone or in a group. In groups it often happens that the non-native speaker is left out a bit, which is also not effective.

But I'm also a bit shocked by the comments that generalize Germans as if we were the cherry on the cake. There are good and bad apples everywhere.

However, I can understand anyone who is having a hard time with all of this. I'm also pretty shy around strangers myself. So I can imagine that it is harder for non-Germans to find a connection. 

In this case, the Internet can be really helpful in finding groups, clubs and meetings. 

However, you shouldn't bend over backwards for ""Germans"" if they only want to be friends with you under specific points/rules. We are far from all like that."

I'm not German but I've spent about a year there (close to Munich) because my family lives there and this is what I've learned.

When moving to a new country, its important to accept and respect the traditions of the new country, Germany included. My mom is in contact with a lot of immigrants and the one thing most of them have in common is the lack of understanding regarding different customs, cultures, and social norms people practice in Germany. I'll give a few examples:

My parents stay in a small farming town and 99% of the residents go to Church on Sundays and sometimes Fridays. We aren't a religious family so my parents don't join them at church, but at the same time, they comment (and used to complain) that shops and businesses are closed on Sundays because of this. We come from a city where shops are open 7 days a week and open from 8-5 so shops closing on Sundays is extremely inconvenient for them. 

Instead of accepting and understanding that shops are closed on Sundays, my parents and other expats (in the beginning at least) complained and called the shops inefficient and annoying (because they couldn't plan to get what they needed on Saturday). If shops close on Sundays and any other day, you have to options: Accept it and plan ahead, or complain and say ""woe is me"" because the shop owners dare to prioritize their personal life over your needs. The latter option will make you miserable, so think a little before you chastise people who have a different culture than you do. 

On the same note, familes and people you meet aren't going/shouldn't have to change their traditions (like church on Sundays, etc.) because of you. If you know the person/people you want to hang out with are busy on Sundays from 8am-12pm and you invite them to something in that time (which they decline), don't assume its because they don't want to spend time with you (and by default assume they don't want to be your friend). Work around people's schedules if possible, and if not possible, maybe choose different friends or different activities. 

You are in a new country, assuming or expecting people to work around you or make concessions because you don't know the language or are ""new"" is part of the problem. Making friends and being accepted into a new society is a two way street, but only if everyone involved understands why the oncoming ""driver"" drives the way they do without saying they are wrong because they have different view points."

Unlike a purely functional living arrangement (Zweck-WG), an active WG provides much more than just accommodation – it's your gateway to building a fun social life. Your flatmates become your built-in language partners (you dont need the Sprachcafe with a WG), offering constant opportunities to practice German in casual, everyday situations. They'll naturally introduce you to their friend circles and invite you to join their hobbies and activities, though there's no pressure to participate.

The practical benefits are equally valuable. Having German-speaking flatmates helps tremendously with navigating bureaucracy and paperwork, as they understand the local system and can guide you through it. They're alsothe best resources for discovering regional events, travel destinations, and hidden gems in the area. The natural flow of shared living means you'll develop genuine friendships without the awkwardness of forced social situations.

In essence, if you're in your twenties and moving to Germany, prioritize finding an active, social WG – it's one of the best decisions you can make for both your social life and and having a fun time here."

I don't want to leave her alone and have fun. But she is afraid to go to clubs or expat meetings for example. What should I do? I once took her to an exhibition at the Atelier Wäscherei in Offenbach and she enjoyed talking to Germans and people from other countries, but I couldn't take her there a second time, which is a pity. They promised to tell her how she can get a design degree in Germany, and they have similar interests, because she is also an artist."

People who think this is narrow-minded or closed or intolerant in any way will struggle to befriend locals not in Germany, but everywhere. 
The first country I lived outside my own was one with a shared language and even though the language barrier was not a factor, everything else still applied. People will not actively come to you to become their friends if they already have their own activities, groups of friends, routines, etc. You are not THAT cool."

Sure, we wanna appreciate it, but doesn't mean we wanna be a part of it ourselves. If this is a barrier when it comes to making friends then the problem is the people from such a place and not us. The language part is understandable but hey, I made Dutch friends in rhe Netherlands without speaking a word of Dutch? I even dated a woman from Indonesia without knowing Indonesian. Once again, if a language proves to be a barrier in making friends, the people of the place are part of the problem. This is just unwelcoming behavior. Plus, one shouldn't have to take so many steps to make friends. I'm friends with Germans, Turks, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Italians, Dutch and a lot of ppl from different cultures.

Germany is not attractive for high-skilled workers, scientists or experts. Due to the close-mindedness of its people, the country is attractive to those who are not keen on integrating anyways but  to live off the social system. Those who have something to give will find more favorable conditions in other countries. Exploitive foreigners are more likely to remain, further reinforcing the locals prejudices against Ausländer and leading to an even more dramatic isolation of that group. It is a vicious cycle and in mathematics we say the system has bad initial conditions :)

As soon as the interest you share disappears, they will stop talking to you. Meeting just for the sake of meeting because you value social interactions is not a concept their brains can process. They specifically want something from you in exchange, call that sharing a hobby, money or whatever, otherwise you’re just wasting their time and you are useless, that’s the harsh reality with Germans."

Frankly, the language clicked after my courses and was a thousand times better because I didn’t care as much anymore about making mistakes. And I made a lot of mistakes. 
It got a lot easier after that to make connections because I got the jokes, could catch the common sayings, and started picking up on dialects even. These gave me conversation starters. My neighbors and I connected over a shared joke. My best friend and I connected over song lyrics. It branched from there, having someone local introducing me to their friends."

I had the same issue with english. Your emotions are deeply connected  with words and language. Same like music. The Songs you heard at the beach sitting at the Camp fire are now connected with the good time. The Song from your Alarm in the morning too.
With you and german,  your connection to the language is hard study, frustration, Performance anxiety and awkward missunderstandings. Thats depressing. But it will not stay like that. After you made friendships and especially if you had an relationship in german, all new emotions get mixed in, forming you aged personality. For me, english was first an least favorite school subject and then work language with stress. Even deep talk didn't feeled genuine.  That changed and I am glad it did. 


In the meantime, reading books or watching Shows you love dubbed in german can help a bit. But sadly, you need real connections and time to make the desired progress. Best of luck.


(And yes, I have friends from syria, poland and more. They become friends with me kinda through that method above. But most Importantly,  they made consistently efforts. It's something why I love my these friends)."

Some of us are fine with integration. But in general Europe especially Central Europe and east Europe require you to assimilate rather then integrate. This is an unconscious fact.

It doesn’t fit with the narrative of Multiculturalism or other ideologies. It’s doesn’t mean you hate someone. Well it is against what the Zeitgeist preaches. But It is nothing bad and it doesn’t  make someone a bad person either. We are just not like the US or other countries in this region of the world. Every one is different and that’s fine.

Eat our shit kinda post by OP. My take is simple to foreigners -dont destroy their culture dont disturb them let them be with their 9 point to do list and kinds, dont break their laws and rules( its their country after all) and be with the foreigners in your groups. Dont die under the hill of all this 9 point to do list. Some foreigners I saw just wanted to follow 100 point to do list to become  over-german. To those foreigners i say you wont land up anywhere it wont get you any „friend for life“. Keep it simple just dont disturb their culture stick to your effing roots earn money pay taxes go do holiday. Dont look for a f** manual on how to make german friends. And this effing „Directness“- all get this clear in your brain I‘ve heard this enough from the Germans as well as the Dutch gloating in glory of directness - „we are direct“ , my ears hurt now with this lie. Directness is a two way traffic and for both Dutch and Germans its one way which means they will be direct but they cant handle it when people are direct with them- it offends them. This bullshit i dont buy at all. And if you still dont agree then like i saw some of those foreigners dying to become german and make german friends - do those - what are those?- 1) Walk to the Bahn station with sad and annoyed face with your boots making noise and walking fast. 2) BUY YOURSELF NORTHFACE, jack wolfskin JACKET, for winter buy canada goose or wellenstyn jackets, Solomon shoes and Deuter bags, climb the hills until you fant like a dog and yet keep the tendency to overdo it. mix water in wine and drink that wineshorle with a dream you will be adopted soon- Importantly stop your effing sense of humor and be all time serious, laugh at poor jokes and look around if it brings tears of joy to them(Germans) - then you can consider yourself to have safely made it to the german foster home. Lastly to balance it out i say as a foreigner do not shake their(German) culture or laws- its their(Germans) country dont do the shit you will do in your country here, some foreigners made it a point to make other foreigners life difficult. Keep it simple and you may not need a German friend remember be it german friend or any friend- friendship should happen naturally not by rulebook, else you will be just fine with another foreigner. Regarding language learn enough so that you can manage your day to day to life and dont die under the hill of all this nonsense"

You don't think speaking the language of the country you want to be a part of is important? 

\> Its much more reasonable for a german to be friends using english with immigrants than expecting an immigrant to complete this list.

It's too awkward to speak english with friends, so this will not work with the majority of people. We speak german with friends, so if you only know english, you will be left out after some time."

I just find this post bizarre. Of course you should learn the language, it takes time though. But it’s worth it and solves 99% of problems that foreigners face. 

But people still move and want to be on the same level with other people. That’s hard to do with B1, let alone with beginner level. So they find people who also speak English and stick to them. And then they feel comfortable enough so that they stop improving their German or looking for German friends (who’d speak with them in German).

So the suggestions cannot work because they ignore the reality, that is if you don’t have fluent German, you can’t speak German with natives on equal level, you can’t discuss complicated topics, etc. making it super difficult to form a friendship"

How to make German friends in Germany - from a German ,YesSirLaughsALot,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1how2es/how_to_make_german_friends_in_germany_from_a/,Caststriker,"> Most germans will switch to English if you ask them to repeat something or if they detect that you're not above C1.

Not where I live, I can tell you that much. Anyone above 40 probably doesn't speak a word of english (or is very very limited in their vocabulary) over here. So you might have more success with russian than english. And anyone who is able to speak english probably moves to the west so they can earn almost double the salary.

Also I personally never switch to english except when I can see that what I'm trying to say goes into one ear and out the other because of a language barrier. 

>Honestly the people who just say bluntly they will not learn have it right.

The point of this post is about people who feel lonely and cry that no locals ever befriended them. 

If your only goal is to make money and then leave after a few years then I don't see why you should integrate, learn the language or befriend the locals, but people that want to stay in germany and befriend germans should make an effort."

Germans, once we are your friend, will do a lot for you and are willing to sacrifice our time also for not so fun things together. E.g. it’s very common to help your friends move, even if they live in an apartment in the 6th floor with no elevator and it’s your only free day of the week. We will come over and bring you soup or groceries when you’re sick, and if you suffer from a hard time we will try to be there for you in whatever way we can, even if we’re not having a great time with you for a bit.

Our cultural comparison is always the US, which is known to be very superficial/I‘ve met „close friends“ who disappeared as quickly as they came and were only there for the fun. 

I’m sure there are countries which have less social „requirements“ and still deliver a lot in friendships but this is part of our „efficiency based“ society. "

Thats why i also think its hard internationals (i assume international students is meant) to find any german friends, not just aquaintances. 

Basically having a „deadline“ for your friendship before it even began is gonna keep alot of german from „investing“ into that person. 

And i think it must be sad. But imagine your already have a friend group. For a decade or more. They will probably be here forever. You got shared interests, language and worldview. 

I think it would be really hard to add someone to that who, maybe doesnt share your interests outside of going to the same uni or company, doesnt share the language and culture and more importantly will probably be gone in 4-6 years. 

This person will probably be never more than an acquaintance. 

Before uni i was a year in the army in a different city. I had „friends“ there or rather people i did stuff with from time to time. I was still very lonely. When i got out i never really saw them again and i was glad to be back with my old friends.

Now imagine also not speaking the language, not having a shared culture. Tbh seems like a nightmare to me personally"

The constant wiggling of the left thumb-stick to act as “counter-steer” is just stupid. my setups are 95% to the rear and 5% to the front. As I can’t change just my rear tyres and front tyres to different compounds, I find it feels much more realistic than RWD. Considering the majority of the Weight Is over the front wheels (the engine). The Front wheels don’t grip anywhere near as much as they should. And having to put race slick tyres and or drag slicks just to counter that, ruins all levels of realism by its self. You may come back with “well why do you use snow tyres?” That’s simply because I enjoy the loss of traction compared to drift tyres that grip up whenever you’re off the throttle. Plus the angles you can hold with little to no effort make them a viable option for point drifting."

I do understand what you are saying though. They are hard to swing sometimes, maybe it's also the camber, because it seems he maximizes the rear camber just as much as front. I'm holding angles ok, its AWD so I do ok on that part, transitions though, you make a valid point. Ever since I started using his tunes, I have them almost on all my cars, so I don't really have a point of reference, nothing to compare it to. I will give it a shot though. Cheers."

Eventually I asked him why we stopped dating, and he said it was because he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I said that made sense.  A month goes by, and he texts me asking why I had asked that question. And I said well, because I still have feelings for you. 

Another week of awkwardness, then one night we shared a hug that was clear neither of us wanted to end. He asked for a kiss, my heart melted, and we had a lovely evening.

I used to clean houses on the side for extra cash. I cleaned his for almost a year without ever meeting him. (My mother is now married to the guy who used to be his roommate, that’s how everyone knew each other and I got the key from her). 

Got out of an abusive relationship, moved in, but since we had opposite schedules only really saw each other on the weekends. 

We got along fantastically, and became good friends fast. 

One day something clicks in my brain and I realize I’m attracted to him. 

A few months later after building sexual tension, we discuss the elephant in the room and decide to bang it out as FWB, fully aware it would probably blow up in our faces. 

About a year later, he felt uncomfortable about our age gap/strong feelings and suggests I date people “my age”. (I was 25 at this time, he was 33). I was very hurt and pissed off so immediately set up a dating profile. I’m relatively attractive and have a fit body, so dates were easy to get and I went out several times a week and had fun. 

I figured either I would find someone to date seriously or he would get jealous and realize he wanted to be with me. 

During this time we were still hooking up occasionally. 

Almost 2 months in he sits me down and sheepishly admits he “really didn’t like” me dating other people, and would I consider being exclusive with him.

I told him I would consider it but I had sort of been regularly seeing 1 guy in particular. 

I made him sweat it out over the weekend. The following Monday or Tuesday, I sat him down and told him I ended everything with the other guys/girls, (I’m bisexual), and I was down to try dating him exclusively. 

And that’s all she wrote. We’ve been married almost 4 years now. Definitely the exception to the rule of don’t fool around with roommates lol."

Which will you regret more on your deathbed: not taking a shot and losing her to another guy at some point, or taking a shot and probably ruining a friendship if she says no? I know I’d regret the former and probably would kick myself at the end of my days.

So, don’t regret anything. Be a man and “come correct”. Lay it out: I’ve developed romantic feelings for you, and I’m hoping you may be interested in exploring them. They say good romantic relationships are built on foundations of friendships - and we’re both close friends, so, maybe you want to see where this goes?"

My marriage broke up in 2009. I’ve been alone with just my kids since. I got to the point in the past couple of years that I was good on my own. And then earlier this year someone I’ve known since first year of secondary school (so over 30 years now) and then that I worked closely with from about 2008 to 2014 until he moved and then I moved, admitted he’s loved me for years. And I can say that I’ve loved him since 2011. I actually switched my shifts to not work directly with him at that point. We’re both divorced now for awhile, but its this completely bizarre mix of knowing all these things about each other, things they would never come up or be brought up early in a relationship, but also still finding new things. Currently there’s about five hours between us, so all we can do is talk. But we’ve already begun making plans for work transfers and such. 

A year ago, six months ago, I’d never have said we’d be more than friends.  Turns out life is completely bizarre and weird and wacky and wonderful sometimes. I hope this eventually happens for you."

Like, to envision scenarios where he’d fall in love with another and marry them. To ask myself, would I be able to attend that wedding and support him as a friend and love the spouse he chose for life? 

And I found that, it would be hard as fuck, but I believe I could do it. And that was when I realized that eventually I did want to shoot my shot, because I knew I’d be ok if he said no. I knew I loved him enough to care about his individual happiness over my own desire to be with him. 

Should things not work out, I know I’ll be ok. Because I love him more than I love being with him, and don’t get me wrong, I *love* being with him. 

But to me, that’s how I decided I wouldn’t be risking the friendship by asking. If I couldn’t come to that conclusion after months of introspection, I’d never have asked him why we stopped dating. 

I wish for good things for you. May your crush return the affection, and May you be tempered against any difficulties that come your way. I know your pain, and I don’t envy you carrying it. May you find fulfilling happiness."

Rejection isn’t a big deal if you don’t make it one! If they’re your friends and you already have a deep connection, you should be able to spill your guts in confidence!

AND, if the other person decides to become a horrible person afterwards, changing of personality or ghosting you, etc, it just shows that maybe they weren’t who you thought they were and its better that it ends before you find out some other time!.

“I like you, I feel you enjoy spending time with me, we’re great together and I just want to be with you in good times and bad times. I want to keep making you happy if that’s ok with you.” Simple as that, and if there’s a “oh, I’m sorry, I just don’t feel that way”— NO WORRIES. You still love them, right? That doesn’t mean you’ll stop just because you’re rejected. You care about that person and want their happiness regardless, right? So it’s fine! No harm done, you just wanted them to know how important they are to you.

And who knows… sometimes after a confession the other person starts to see you in a different light and they might come round~? But life is too short not to tell those you love the most, how much you really love them! We might not be here tomorrow! We might not survive the day, anything can happen anytime, so why not love? ❤️

Good luck to anyone reading this, you got this ❤️ everything will turn out ok!"

Kaya changjng our mindset towards a certain thing is really the first unlock na need natin in also changing the course of our life.

Whether or not may mga supernatural forces behind this practice o wala, it totally depends on you.

And as for those na nag-effort din naman daw pero olats parin, well, this is tricky. It may appear kasi na nag-effort pero yung activities nila are still aligned with the very thing na ayaw nila. 

Like gusto nila ng financial abundance pero stuck parin sila sa ""hustle dito, hustle doon"" of making money. Yung tipong pinapatos kahit ano basta magkapera lang. 

I'd say effort din naman yun. Diskarte nga rin siguro to some extent. 
But is it aligned to the abundance na gusto mo? Not really."

These are not the same because manifesting doesn’t involve replacing practical steps, like budgeting, with something harmful.

Unlike taking an unproven pill, manifesting doesn’t cause harm and can help people stay focused and motivated as long as it’s paired with real actions (which OP stated).

Dismissing someone’s personal experience as invalid assumes there’s only one way to solve a problem, but people use different strategies, and if manifesting worked for them without hurting anyone, it shouldn’t be criticized."

It is not just a mindset, and it is dishonest of you and everyone else in this thread to keep saying this. Obviously I would not blink twice if OP just said optimism and goal-setting worked for them.

LOA is a claim about the world that thoughts are energy and that therefore thinking certain thoughts can attract similar energy and *manifest* good things into reality. So, a miracle formula. In the case of OP, I'm glad it worked out. But there are many cases where people learn about LOA and spend too much time on manifesting, or forget that the real world has boundaries, because of those supernatural claims.

It is survivorship bias to imply that ""LOA works and is harmless"" just because it worked for OP. To go back to my analogy, even if the person shared that they had taken the pill *and* done chemo, I would still think there's potential for harm for readers with cancer to rely on the pill."
Any free sites or apps that I can use to learn the language fluently?,PuzzleheadedCity6299,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1icjojr/any_free_sites_or_apps_that_i_can_use_to_learn/,clawtistic,"No one free site will get you fluency, I’m afraid. But some resources…:

\- Are you an American? See if your library offers “MangoLanguages”. It’s free through many libraries and is a really good tool. If your library doesn’t, or you’re not American, see if anyone online can add you to their free family plan. Due to complications, I’m on my husband’s family plan, he has it for free through his library.

  
\- AnkiWeb for flash cards. This pairs really well with a word frequency dictionary.

\-There’s a free online word frequency dictionary. You can also download it for free as a pdf.

\-Again, are you an American? See if your library has Hoopla. From there, you can access a plethora of free resources—and if your library’s Hoopla offers something called “The Great Courses” under bingepass, there are… I think 30 French lesson and culture courses. They also might have a lot of audiobooks and ebooks on Hoopla for French. Take a peek!!

\-Even if you’re not American, see if your library—school or public—has any resources or Language Learning programs.

\-Substitial is a browser extension on Firefox, it will let you search for and inject French subtitles into any video player you can find if, for some reason, Netflix or Crunchyroll or whatever video site you use doesn’t Have French subtitles. You might have to look up the series youre watching in French, though. When I was watching the French dub of Vanitas, I had to look up the subtitles by searching the show’s name in French.

\-Need reading material, and Hoopla doesn’t have anything that piques your interest? Go to webtoon, set your language to French, and see if there’s anything that you like (if you already use webtoon) or, if you don’t use webtoon, see if there’s anything you might like. Grab a dictionary, and try to read. You might need to ask around or look some things up, but. It’s fun to reread School Bus Graveyard in French, if I’m honest. This helps me with vocab and grammar a lot. Webtoon is free."

My journey in Japan started back in my home country, where I met my now wife at college. We were together almost her entire stay in my country and we didn’t want to split up, so I dropped my original plans for after college and went with her to Japan. I entered a language school here. That’s when stage 1 happened.

But then my story is all over the place compared to your stages. I made a lot of friends, foreigner and Japanese even when my Japanese was still N4 level.

I studied until I reached N3, and got kinda bored and lazy in school, so my classmates made it to N2 by graduation but I didn’t lol. Didn’t really matter to me though, I was doing whatever I wanted anyways. 

After we got married, I was able to get the nice relaxing spice visa, and do remote work from home. She was able to quit her job and we started a family of our own.

I bought an awesome sports car and joined a friend group of cool foreigners and Japanese car dudes who love going on drives and to car meets.

Now we had our second kid this year, so now I have two. One two and half year old and a four month old and they’re lovely.

I paid off all my debts this year and just begun working on my dream job, making my own video game studio. I hired my first employee just this week.

That’s been my journey in Japan. Turns out you can live quite a lot of life just at the N3 level!"

Arrive in Japan already having been before, speak Japanese, have a degree in Japanese history/ culture so naturally have an air of snobbery about you as you look at all the fresh of the boat babies. Spend a year or two on JET being the big fish in a small pond. Become a fk boy. Have no real friends as you only are meeting people at bars and sleeping with women. See everyone you knew going back home to get their actual career on track. Have a panic attack.
2. Get a proper job in the working sector. Realise you are not hot shit as there are already other foreigners who have been here longer/ have way better Japanese. Tell yourself to grow the fuck up but you probably wont.
3. Get depressed as all the actual friends you meet only ever stick about for a couple of years so you get fatigue from going through that whole find friend > be happy > lose friend > be sad cycle. Due to exhaustion discover better hobbies than getting wasted and sleeping about.
4. Life is good. Levelled job up, decent pay, decent time, good fun hobbies, regular gf too. This is the golden period. This stage people usually actually grow the fuck up. But eventually the inevitable boredom kicks in. Get married.
5. Wife tells you that you should be content with life as you have her. She is always right so probably just listen to her  but you actually long for chillin with the boyz. Turn to the internet/ discord/ gaming to hang with the OG boyz back home who were always there for you. This step is similar to step 4 but half the time is spend with the wife.

Here does not seem so very different from moving to a new town in England. At first I don't really know anyone - or someone I already know incidentally but just them - and it is pretty lonely. Everyone has their own lives and finding a way in is difficult. But over time I do things and then life gets busy. My Japanese is not great, but people make allowances and I can still have fun talking to people even if it is not as easy as it should be.

I think it took about that long in Swindon for me to really start to have a social life, and Leamington Spa was not very different - a bit faster but for various rather special reasons.

So perhaps I had some stage 2 at first, but that would be the same in England. I've not really had the opportunity of seeing enough foreigners to be able to avoid them.

I also had the occasional western food (including occasional McD's) probably a couple/few months in.

Stage 3 just didn't exist for me (I never really got into anything Japanese that way nor did I every live in denial or hide wanting western food sometimes).

It came on the heels of a stalker as well, but got rid of all my social media for over a year, never rejoining FB, twitter , etc. (and never having insta, tiktok, etc.). I always had Japanese friends, at least nomitomo, though I did have periods where the lack of a partner were particularly painful (though certainly NOT after the whole stalker thing for a while -- and I was just an average-looking dude in his 30s at the time so I found crazy for sure).

For Stage 5, I think the only stuff I accumulated was one guy's extra diaso odds and ends when I was in a sharehouse, and Japanese friends' stuff when they got married such as a fridge (usually for helping them move). I've been married for a few years now (though not from friends introducing us; the few times that happened, it fell apart).

---

I don't think I agree with those five stages, really, but I also came over nearly 10 years ago in my early 30s, had moved around and started over before, etc.  Some parts of them do ring true, but I think it differs a lot on personality and situation. Now, I'm in my early 40s, happily married, do most stuff in Japanese on my own (with some reading help from the wife and/or google sensei since my reading is not great particularly with really formal/legal stuff). I don't really have many close friends, but that's always been the case and it doesn't bother me.  I think it's also natural that people get married and/or move away and become less available. My refusal to get back on almost any social media probably hinders maintaining some relationships, but I also don't think I care at this point.

People coming to Japan to run from something, including themselves, are just going to get a short reprieve and then become tired and start running again. The solution for that is fixing the underlying mental health or other issues."

The 5 stages of Gaijin,hillbourne,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1g50o6p/the_5_stages_of_gaijin/,sakuratanoshiii,"I loved reading your story.  For me it is like this - 

Stage 1.  This stage lasted a long time.  I arrived in 1991, just before you.  I had a working holiday visa and a wide variety of interesting part-time jobs.  My colleages and gaijin house mateys were like me - very adventurous, we had travelled, worked and lived in other countries before coming to Japan and I was also working and living with Japanese people who had lived and worked in other countries, so we were all in high spirits every day AND NIGHT and loved every single facet of being in Tokyo, Japan.  The most interesting part is even though we had all wandered about the world on a shoestring, nowhere was like Tokyo!!!  

The economy was HIGH!  The pay was HIGH!  People in certain circles were HIGH!

What does ""wasplain"" mean?  I'm not sure if I was involved in that or not.

I made lots of friends (Japanese and gaijin) very quickly and easily once I was released from the tentacles of my Japanese family in Saitama and Kanagawa and moved to Shin-Nakano.  Levelling Up from family to gaijin house to my own apato with a Mt Fuji view was extremely exciting!  

Stage 2.  My working holiday visa was running out.  I did not want any sort of family sponsorship so I signed up to a Japanese Language School in order to get the correct visa.  All of a sudden I could converse more and more with local people that were not my family bossing me about.  It was so much fun!  My life was harder because I had to go to Japanese School in the morning and then usually go to 2 or 3 other jobs after that.  Yet there was still a very ecclectic social life to be had.  Looking back, I often laugh at how much energy I had.  My holidays were often in Japan, or other places in Asia and rarely back to Australia.  I set up a Japanese language school in Bali.

Stage 3.  Very very sad.  After living the high life for such a long time, it all came crashing down.  I lived with a lovely Japanese guy and we had a beautiful daughter together.  However, his family did not like the gajin situation and took our daughter and my whole world came crashing down in a tremendous tsunami.  Somehow she passed away.  And I thank the little Jizo shrines each and every day for the rest of my life.

Stage 4.  Broke up with the man.  He was emotionally unavailable.  Working very hard and partying very hard.  Then Nova went under.  My main salary at that point in time.

Stage 5.  Went on the dole until the paltry pay out.  Then went to live in Thailand for a while."

Stage 1 is almost exactly what I lived through…fresh off the plane. 

But what followed has been awesome:

learning Japanese, feeling I know more and more words and using it to do more and more complex things like getting my drivers licence or watching a tv show or reading a book! I rarely get frustrated. 

I’ve also met a lot of great people, Japanese especially, with which I’m developing beautiful relationships. 

My wife is Japanese too, and she is the best. 

Hamburgers and pizzas here are now better than almost anywhere else so that’s not an issue anymore. Japanese food is still awesome (except natto and Shirako).

I DO avoid foreigners, but not all. Only the ones that feel like they’re here to get laid or escape their insecurities. Those leave ok the first 5 years always and rarely want to build a good friendship. 

I DO miss my family a lot, and old friends, but I feel like I would miss people everywhere I go now.

The stage would have to be nuanced because gripes become “go back to your country” when (NHK as an example), pleeeenty of Japanese hate the idea of paying NHK but the layer of being a foreigner is an attribute that can be used against you. Like other attributes. I remember my sister (in the states) being told by a well meaning bank manager “I know, women have a hard time filing out forms” when she asked for a new one. 

I think I should have said something like stage seven is when being a foreigner is just an aspect of you with all the good and bad that come with that.

I could understand a fair bit of what she was asking but was bumfuzzled about how to reply.  She did enjoy playing with the soft bait I was throwing at the bass we could see in the water and enjoyed running the small bass over to the waiting cats.  I have been getting more and more motivated over the last couple of months as my other interests have waned that I need to really buckle down and make an effort to improve my Japanese to at least a conversationally functional level.

That being said, yes, there are a depressingly large number of people who came here and were given an entry level job that involved ""being able to speak your native language"" and never developed any skills otherwise.  And even worse since there seems to be a never ending supply of people who're willing to put off their lives for 3-5 years (until the I honeymoon phase really wears off) there is a never ending supply of FotBers that keep the people who have gained skills at this job they're doing from being able to earn an actual living at it.  Never mind the disservice it does the people they're trying to teach dumbing things down to the ""this is an apple"" level since that's really the average quality of the people who're trying to do the job, badly.

One of my kids recently took the Eiken so they could skip the English part of their college entrance exams.  They're doing the highest level which involves a speech section.

I came over with no degree on a spouse visa.  I have quite a bit of savings and own my house etc, so I’m not too hard off, but it’s basically because I got lucky a few times in life and made a few good financial decisions.

Career wise I feel like an idiot.  There’s a lot of stuff I want to do that just isn’t feasible here too.  I started my pilots license before moving to Japan and still think about that sometimes.  I could have bought a ranch house with a lot of land out in Wyoming or somewhere cheap and been flying a bush plane on fat wheels now.  Instead I opted for a different country and chose a different kind of bush.

Probably just normal up and downs and a little bit of season depression mixed in with my job recently blowing up in my face.  I don’t normally have anxiety but I got super addicted to nicotine and caffeine megadoses while doing crazy hours at my job, and I think all the stimulants sent my anxiety through the roof tbh.  I assume it’ll pass and stage 14 will be loving Japan again.

I have a fairly large budget and just the land of the size I want is like 40/50M.

I don’t want to say anything to identify him, but he tries very hard to NOT look wealthy.  His shop looks old and rough, he doesn’t own a car, he only rides a shitty ママチャリ, and super modest clothing.  You would never guess he was rich unless you hung around his business long enough to calculate the money changing hands and most people aren’t doing that.

Yes for me the first problem as the Japanese and British (Japan resident) best friends of my son’s father pleaded for my son to come (it was during the Covid lockdown of Japan) so they could receive confirmation of his death. Without my son appearing to the Ward Office and Coroners, in person, no other soul could learn the details of his lonely death. It was a great irony as in my Donna whole life, his father deliberately chose not to know him. The next problem was, I wasn’t sure his father had registered his koseki in Tokyo at the time of his birth, and the Japanese police and his friends there weren’t able to find it in Hiroo, Ebisu - where he passed. We were told he must have not done it, and so he couldn’t apply for a Japanese passport, or visit at that time (as Japan was closed then to non citizens due to Covid restrictions). It was on a solo hike in Mt Aspiring National Park, following a river amongst ancient trees, after being dropped into the mountains by helicopter, that I received a message from the trees. (I’m not joking)…. I heard ‘go home and search your old correspondence, I DID register him…!) this day by pure coincidence was also the birthdate of his deceased father (21 January). After this trip I rushed home, searched old letters and found the one from him telling me he had registered his birth at Shibuya Ward Office. I contacted the NZ embassy in Tokyo and struck a very helpful and kind Japanese guy who understood this koseki problem, chased it down and rang me with such excitement yo tell me he had found the koseki…. Thus we could go from there. There have been many more amazing spiritual coincidences of the highest order during this journey, including during our travels this journey in Japan (another, again on his father’s birthday, 21 January, in when we were in Tokyo this year)…. It’s impossible to explain the kind of miracles that have occurred on this journey, my friend. The world is a mysterious place. We are going to NSW this summer and my son will commence his own journey studying reiki… I think it will ultimately lead him back to Japan, as he already misses this country very much, despite being a total gaijin there….

We were paid peanuts, no respect at all, we weren’t allowed to drive to work bc our boss wanted us to study on the train to and from work, and also he wanted us to study on our lunch break, then after work they would send YouTube videos for us to watch before coming to work the next day.  All that studying added up to 4-5 hours of unpaid work a day.  The only way to go from peanuts to peanuts PLUS was to show that you had learned a lot.
