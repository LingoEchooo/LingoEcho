"After exactly 50 hours, 43 minutes, and 56 seconds, I reached the end of the 5,091 word Lingvist French deck!",allenthalben2,https://i.redd.it/6144a6sci1v71.png,allenthalben2,"Just super excited, because I've never finished a deck this big before.

Lingvist keeps track of the time, that's how I know. Although it will be off by a few minutes, because I also spent time on my self-created deck. More stats:

* I did flashcards on **138 days**

* In total I have answered **19,795 cards**

* This works out as approximately **143 cards seen for each day** I used Lingvist.

* Lingvist estimates I can understand approximately 91% of the words of a text (in reality, it is usually higher depending on the text-style due to the borrowings of Latinate words into English).

* The word I had the most trouble with was *deviner* (to guess, figure out) which I have practiced 36 times.

I would highly recommend Lingvist, but is not free. It costs me about £15 a month (if you wish to buy it — **pay on the website** and ***then*** download the app., because it's more expensive if you buy it on the app), which I know is not super cheap for some people, but on many occasions it's been the only thing that stops me from completely abandoning French. I think I paid in Euros actually because of my location at the time, so it may have worked out as ~£13 after exchange.

The languages they offer for EN speakers are: French, German, Spanish (European and Latin American), Portuguese, and Russian.

Happy to answer any other Qs."

This is correct, and I'm almost embarrassed how long it took for me to connect it. I do it for a lot of French words, connecting them in some way etymologically. The last other example I can think of is 'soupira' (inf. soupirer: to sigh) where I realised the -pira was related with the -pire in respire, expire. 

There's something beautifully ironic about the word I had the most trouble remembering being 'to figure out, guess'."

Things like novels, and more colloquial speech (e.g. r/rance lmao) go beyond me, which is entirely what I expect. I can manage books graded at the B1 level, and I can read the Little Prince (this is literally the only French book I own atm) without too many troubles.

I did find myself learning astoundingly quickly with Lingvist compared to other Flashcard programmes like Anki, Memorise, and Quizlet — and I'm still not sure why."

I have just seen Lingvist do offer a Classroom version. I've never used that version, so I can't comment, but it definitely could have some advantages with Quizlet. The disadvantage is that it typically is used for only learning individual lexemes, and it's not really used for learning sentences — I also believe on some of the custom-created cards it won't tell you the gender. I would still stick to quizlet, but if there's a trial period for Lingvist classroom I would give it a go to see if it fits your needs!"

Yeah I've used a fair amount of resources — I used a graded reader for A1, A2, A2-B1, and I've considered buying a B1-B2 one. I also owned a few general vocab books, and I watched an old teleseries called 'Bon Courage' (and started with 'C'est ça, la vie') which teaches French in an interactive and over-dramatic way.

For coursebooks I own 'Langue et Civilisation Françaises I' and I have a ''vocabulaire 450 nouveaux exercises'' book on loan. I read Le petit prince and currently a translation of Kafka's ""Brief an den Vater"" as well. I've watched a few kids shows in French, I listen to more French music w/ lyric videos, I have changed a lot of my software and hardware settings to French, and I'm slowly becoming more engaged with French groups in real life.

Unfortunately almost every resource I used was German-French (or just French), besides Lingvist. So it wouldn't be of great help to write them all down."

Looks like it's still gonna take a year to get through the whole deck but that should be just in time for my trip to Spain :\^)

I suppose it works faster because it forces you to produce the word and type it out, and also recites the whole sentence in spoken form (albeit a computer-generated one), which helps with reinforcement. Also, Memrise's SRS sucks and I'm not sure about Quizlet. Anki works well but the pre-made decks tend to be a little bad or focus on only vocab without words in context, and it can take a while to build your own deck."

Yes that's true. I'm glad it's not only me who hates Memrise's SRS, which is a shame because there's far more content on there then Anki shared decks usually. They must have developed a better algorithm for Lingvist.

Quizlet is okay, but it has the same kinda issue as Anki. You need to often build your own deck, because others might not include gender/plural/other info. But I definitely enjoy using Quizlet more, because there's quite a few modes to practice with."

I started off German with an interest in some music (whereby I'd read the lyrics and translation on lyricstranslate.com) which wasn't tooo dissimilar from French, but then it diverges.

I used to *love* Grammar in German. I have read Hammer's German Grammar (one of the ''Holy Books'' of German grammar) and Dartmouth's German Grammar pages so many times. It helped me do very well in my exams and meant I didn't have to learn any grammar once I reached university. I obsessed oftentimes over my CEFR level quite a lot with German, something that I've only had in mind with French for a possible university ceritificate requirement.

And whilst I undoubtedly learnt a lot and made my life a lot easier, because certain things I acquired earlier than my peers, it didn't advance me along a super amount in terms of lexicon, understandably.

With French it's been a total reversal. I almost *never* look at French grammar and I have internalised a lot of rules based on reading — there are still some things I have to look up (e.g. irregular forms, subjunctive usage), but it will take only a fraction of the time German demanded from me. French has mostly been Lingvist + a lot of reading and general exposure for me. 

Because I don't take French classes, my active skills are quite poor (and trying to be improved) compared to how my German would have been at the time. But my reading and listening (of standard language) comprehension has reached a level quicker than I thought it would have in this time-frame.

I always preferred to just read, it's what I do in German too. I like reading authentic texts in the language, so this is why I directed my focus there. I definitely do more flashcards than I did for German, and I'm slightly more confident using French at a lower level than I was with German.

I feel that I've definitely acquired a passive knowledge of French quite rapidly, but of course each comes with it's own caveats. I can understand the French when they speak like a newsreader, or like Hugo French does, but I still cannot deal with natural speech easily because of how much is 'sacrificed' when they speak fast. I didn't have this issue so much with German."
Does anyone here use Lingvist?

Clearly enough, the staff is better at IT than at language teaching. When I tried it out (back when it started just with French, when I had already had C2), I found a lot of problems, such as too many anglicisms prefered over pure French and commonly used words. Sometimes a secondary meaning of a word was taught as the main one, even if it is almost never used in real life, and a more common word was not taught,... Really, their team was clearly missing someone actually knowledgeable about French use and teaching.

When I asked their support questions like ""what type of resources is your frequency list based on"" (which is a very good question. You will get vastly different lists, based on whether you take words common in newspapers, or those common on tv, or those common in harder to get real life samples), they avoided any answer. When I asked about a rather problematic example, I got a very stupid patronising answer showing a lot of ignorance on Lingvist's side.

Really, Lingvist is imho not a too good option. Some better alternatives:

\-Speakly: also ready made 4000 words, but clearly made by people with teaching experience

\-some high quality user made decks on Memrise (not the official trash), such as +French and +Spanish by Eunoia

\-some high quality decks (or your own) in Anki"

But there were some things I didn't like when using it 
 
- the sentences seemed randomly chosen, often talking about business
- I encountered a relatively high number of errors, both in my NL and TL (German/Spanish)
- I can't remember an overview of the words in the learning cycle and an option to go through or manage them independently
- Rather than being forced to type (correctly), I prefer to have the option to sometimes just skip through the cards and rate myself - to save time or when that's more convinient like on mobile  

Don't take these as a recommendation against using it. Just check for yourself if it fits your needs and taste - that's the most important point anyway :)

However in general it has some really poor parts:  
1. The word count includes duplicates so it's not a true word count. I've manually verified that I know at least 2500 words by going through an anki deck without duplicates, but it would be so easy for them to just give a true word count. Very annoying.  
2. You can only go back 1 slide  
3. Literally every other feature of the app beside the 150 cards is useless (eg. the grammar exercises)

My German, and Spanish would not be nearly as good as they are if I hadn’t used the app. I’m currently learning Russian with it as well. 

However, I wouldn’t start using it until you’re around A2 in your target language. Especially with Russian, its important that you understand the cases and fine grammar points, or you’ll probably struggle to learn with the app. 

Also, in my experience, its not enough to learn words through flashcards/ memorizing them. You HAVE to actively listen to authentic material to train your ear for them."

Has anyone completed Lingvist? Thoughts?,apricottagecheese,https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/5bc4ju/has_anyone_completed_lingvist_thoughts/,Tylandredis,"It's not a closed system like Duolingo trees. It's potentially endless as it works off the words rather than subject groups. Additionally, with Duolingo you get grammar and syntax; with Lingvist you get vocabulary which is the next step to becoming fluent.     
I LOVE Lingvist. It doesn't hound you to regurgitate vocabulary you already know and you get drilled on vocab you get wrong.  
When a new word gets introduced, it tells you, and if you already know it and enter the correct answer, you'll likely never see it again. This cuts way down on the redundancy and will keep you interested for longer.  
I've sat at the computer and done them for hours before without really noticing. It can be done while you're watching TV or listening to music, etc.  
Definitely try it out. I think you'll be really pleased with it!"

I think that, as a raw beginner, your plate will be pretty full with learning vocab that goes with your grammar anyway. I do really like it though. It's my loo break app of choice.

I was already a C2 learner (confirmed by an exam), not a beginner. I wanted to know what was this new product and whether or not I can recommend it to my friends. Lingvist is a great idea but there are a few troubles:

1.You cannot ignore a word, which can be a problem in various situations, especially the one bellow

2.""mistakes"", making me wonder whether the team actually speaks French. There was a word, quite early on, that is almost never used the way lingvist presented it (I checked in literature, on google, in a good paper dictionary etc.). It is quite a common word, yes, but usually with a bit different meaning. When I asked about it the lingvist help (as an illustration of why an ignore button is needed), I was given a wrong answer using an English analogy. 

3.I didn't even get the answer to a simple question: ""what is the Lingvist content based on, what is the frequency lest drawn from?"" This is a crutial issue. Some frequency lists are based mostly on newspapers, others on tv, others on large studies of real life spoken langauge. And those differ a lot. In my email with questions, I was just being answered it was a frequency list.

In general, I'd say Lingvist is a great idea, but the creators are much more IT specialists than language specialists. And that makes me wonder, whether I can safely use it to learn a new langauge, without risking to learn mistakes."

Pupovac je sjedio pokraj njih sa svojim društvom i čitavo ju vrijeme nepristojno odmjeravao. Rekla mi je da se osjećala neugodno zbog toga. Ona u tom trenutku uopće nije znala tko je on, već joj je bilo neugodno jer ju je nepristojno promatrao čovjek koji je barem dvostruko stariji od nje, a ona je tada bila djevojka od dvadesetak godina. Nakon nekog vremena, Pupovac je prišao mojoj supruzi, dodirnuo joj koljeno, pružio svoju posjetnicu i obratio joj se riječima ‘Ako će ti ikada trebati posao ili bilo što drugo, javi mi se’. Ovaj događaj supruga mi je ispričala nekoliko godina kasnije kada smo ga vidjeli na televiziji”, ispovijeda nam se Saša.

Re spolno uznemiravanje - je li ga se ikad prijavilo?

Re genocid - istinski ne razumijem čega se to tiče.

Re izbori - stoji da se to događalo. Na žalost stoji.

Re Vučić - nemam komentar. Fakat nisam to pratio, istinski me briga za to.

Re SDSS - I? U post Yu okolišu su umalo sve stranke bile napučene bivšim komunjarama i generalno negativnim ljudima. Kako se SDSS, koji nije takva stranka, već je nasljednica, prema tvojim riječima, po tome razlikuje od ostalih?

Re Stanimirović - kako je to Pupovčev krimen? Valjda je Stanimirović tu negativac.

Re neka profesorica - opet, kakve veze Pupovac ima s time? Valjda žena zna za sebe odlučivati.

Re banka - ne znam o novcu dovoljno da mogu komentirati.

Re gušenje glasa - da, u pravu si. Na žalost je tako.

Re koalicija s HDZ-om - Opet si u pravu.

  
Rekao bih da je lik negativna osoba u hrvatskoj politici i ne bi mi bilo krivo kada više nikad ne bih čuo za njega u tom kontekstu. Ali se ne slažem s tvojim komentarima glede SDSS-a, jer nemam dojam da je ta stranka do te mjere ""njegova"". Isto tako ne smatram da je on osobno išta napravio u pogledu Tram 11, njih dvojica su svojim istupima u javnosti i djelima koja su stvarno postala loša sami to učinili.

Hvala na odgovoru."

Znam, imate kolektivne traume od Turaka/Muslimana i grozota koje su vam cinili stotinama godina. Tu mi vas je cak i zao. Nitko to nije zasluzio. Pa cak ni vi.

Po tvojoj logici onda ste vi bili robovi:

- Bugarima

- Madarima

- Turcima

- Rumunjima

- Grcima

- Austrijancima

- Nijemcima

- Albancima (Kosovo)

- Hrvatima (NDH)

Zaboravio sam još neke vjerojatno. Oprostit ces.

Necemo se lagati, sve ima online. Ne piše SANU više službenu povijest. Istina je da se niste se od nikog sami oslobodili.

- Na inicijativu svih europskih sila (i Njemacke i Austrije), ali najvise zbog Rusa, su Turci otjerani sa Balkana. Kazem, 100.000 mrtvih Rusa i 2400 Srba i Crnogoraca sve govori što trebaš znati.

- WW1: bežanija, razbijeni, ostavili nejač i pravac Krf, a onda sa stotinama tisuca Francuza i Britanaca (i Indijaca i Pakistanaca) jadne Bugare otjerali 1918. Nijemci davno napustili bojiste.

- WW2: zahvalite se Titi i Rusima (doslovno oslobodili Beograd), vi ste do 1943/44 vecinom bili Četnici, Ljoticevci ili Nedicevci…mislim i danas ste, ali to je druga prica.

Pa pa."

",AnderArmor,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1exozat,dr_popara02,"Normalno da imamo Muslimane/Turke u ružnom sećanju. Kao i Nemce i Bugare i Habzburge i Italijane i Albance. Veruj imaju i oni nas. Da se nismo borili protiv njih za slobodu i dudlali im tuki vrv bi ih imali u lepom kao i oni nas. Tako da me ne čudi što vi vaše zavojevače imate i lepom sećanju.

Mi za razliku od vas nismo bili robovi jer smo mi svoje lance skidali u svakom trenutku, čak i ako je to značilo istrebljenje a to smo i dokazali 1941. ""Bolje grob nego rob, bolje rat nego pakt"".

Turci nisu oterani sa Balkana na inicijativu evropskih sila. Ono što je protiv Turaka urađeno na inicijativu evropskih sila jeste nezavisnost Srbije, CG i Rumunije 1878, kao i Grčke pre toga. Oni su dobrim delom oterani sa Balkana od strane Srba, Grka, Albanaca i Italijana 1912. Evropske sile su tada sprečile potpuno teranje Turaka sa Balkana.

Da tačno je u prvom svetskom ratu vojska i deo naroda su se povukli na Krf i delom u severnu Afriku. Da je vojska ostala u Srbiji bila bi uništena a vojnici poslati u logore, i posle ništa od borbe za slobodu. Ali Srbin ne voli da bude rob, pa je gladan i bolestan prešao preko Albanije u Grčku da ne bi bio rob. Jbg znam da je teško da razumete vi volite da menjate uniforme kako koja vojska dođe. Ipak mi Srbi smo malo drugačiji. Šta ćeš. Imamo samo jednu i to srpsku uniformu, ne volimo tuđe.

Naravno da smo Titu zahvalni na oslobođenju. Kao što je i Tito Srbima zahvalan jer partizani su ipak bili Srpska vojska sastavljena najvećim delom od Srba. Još smo mu zahvalniji što je porazio ustaše I spasio stotine hiljada Srba ustaškog noža. Zahvalni i za način kako je tretirao ustaše i sve druge zločince. On kad bi se danas nekim čudom probudio pa pola Hrvatske bi u kolonama put Austrije krenulo. Nismo mu zahvalni za sistem koji je uspostavio posle oslobođenja. Totalitarna diktatura sa neodrživim ekonomskim sistemom i neodrživom raspodelom snaga između republika. Srbi sa teritorija nekadašnje AU su mahom bili u partizanima. Istina ojačao je i četnički pokret posle operacije Trio, ali to nije dugo trajalo, i nedugo posle operacije mnogi su se vratili nazad u partizane. To ne znači da nije postojao četnički pokret tu i dalje. Srbi iz bivše Kraljevine Srbije su mahom bili u JVUO do 1944. to je tačno, ali ne u Nedićevcima a naročito ne Ljotićevcima.

Ko što ti kažeš ne piše SANU povijest ali sanu ni ne sprečava nikog da uzme knjigu iz povijesti u ruke i čita malo."

> Istoricii Alin Ciupală, profesor la Facultatea de Istorie – Universitatea București și Dorin Dobrincu, istoric la Institutul A.D. Xenopol din Iași, susțin însă că 10 Mai este Ziua Independenței.

> „În epocă, Independența a fost proclamată pe data de 10 Mai pentru a se lega de figura Principelui, viitorul Rege Carol I. 10 Mai este ziua dinastiei, zi care s-a transformat după 1881, în Ziua Națională a României. Ziua Națională a României s-a sărbătorit pe 10 Mai, vreme de 80 de ani. Din păcate, în ciuda vocilor istoricilor, care au încercat să pună lucrurile la punct și care s-au exprimat de mai multe ori, în ciuda lucrărilor de specialitate, în ciuda Tratatului de Istorie al Academiei, încă în imaginarul colectiv independența e legată de ziua de 9 mai”, subliniază profesorul Alin Ciupală pentru Europa Liberă.

> „Comuniștii au recurs la un artificiu: în ziua de 9 mai s-a citit un act, dar Proclamarea oficială a Independenței era pe 10 Mai”, explică și Dorin Dobrincu."

Ce e cu difotngurile „oa” si „ea”? In momentul in care avem un „o” sau un „e” accentuat, iar in silaba urmatoare avem „a, ă, e” respectiv „a, ă”, atunci in cele mai multe cazuri acele doua litere accentuate se transforma in „oa” si „ea”.

Ex: boala - boli, scoala - scoli, frumos - frumoasa, pleaca - pleci. In mod normal, la inceputul unui cuvant, acel „oa” se citeste „ua”. Nu putem sa ne abatem de la regula asta ortografica, chiar daca la inceput de cuvant de aude mai degraba un „ua” cand citim. Ce a spus Dan Alexe este o ineptie.

Cat despre „damil”, sa stii ca italienii nu folosesc des apostroful (sau cratima in cazul nostru). Ar fi lipsit de logica sa nu folosim cratima din moment ce am decis ca impreunarea unor cuvinte sau elidarea unei vocale se noteaza mereu cu cratima. De ce sa ne abatem de la regula ortografica? Care e sensul?

Daca te intereseaza subiectul, te invit sa citesti „Despre scrierea limbii romane” de Titu Maiorescu, cel care teoretic a inventat ortografia pe care o avem astazi, introducand „principiul intelectual” in scriere, ca un compromis intre fonetism si etimologism."

Da, asa e. Italienii, francezii, spaniolii si celelalte popoare latine au invat de la slavi si isi palatizeze consoanele. Evolutia fonetica naturala a oricarei limbi este cateogric legata de invazia slavilor sau a „barbarilor”.

Na.pandemia todo mundo fez alguma coisa esquisita. La por maio/2020 recebi um rmail.do Rosetta Stone dizendo que todo mundo que ja teve um curso do Rosetta estava recebendo um oresente de pandemia: acesso vitalicio a algum curso. Comprei ha mil anos o rosetta de holandes. Mas ja nao tava interessada em holandes em 2020. Pensei: qual lingua vale a pena ter acesso vitalicio? Russo, que demora.p kct pra aprender bem. Comecei a fazer mas rapidamente se esgotou pq o Rosetta é pessimo. Senti necessidade de mais material ja na segunda lição. Procurei informacoes na internet e achei uma dica aqui no reddit (foi bom pra eu voltar ora ca que tinha largado por um tempao).  Dica do Lingvist. Baixei e comecei a usar. Excelente. 


Mas logo que vi que tinha mais linguas quis turbinar meu alemao que estava estagnado ha dez anos no B1. Uma gde frustracao da minha vida. Comecei a fazer o alemao tb e logo largueino russo e mergulhei no alemao. Em seis meses.consegui começar a ler literatura em alemao e agora to praticamente fluente.


O algoritmo do Lingvist é disparado o melhor de todos. Eu testo varios aplicativos, ele é imbativel. Porque sao.linguistas e engenheiros trabalhando juntos. Eles estao sempre melhorando o aplicativo.


Sobte pagar e a minha sorte: infelizmente o tempo de teste gratis nao é suficiente pra vc sentir a magica. Precisa de uns dois meses de uso diario. Em 2020 quando pegueo eles.tinham uma das assinaturas que era vitalicia. Na epoca.paguei em torno de 720 reais. Mas hoje cinco anos depois esse valor ja se diluiu completamente.


Nao é um.aplicativo barato. Mas se vc precisa aumentar o vocabulario e é organizado pra estudar sozinho, nao tem nada tão bom"
