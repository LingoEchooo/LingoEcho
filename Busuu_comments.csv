Vivere is to be alive. Abitare shares a common root with words like inhabit and habitat in English that are tied to physical place. 

Abitare is therefore more specific to physical residence, whereas vivere has a broader meaning that covers the idea of “living” as an experience, lifestyle, or just being alive as opposed to dead. 

The two can overlap when discussing where you live though so, for example, “Abito a Napoli.” and “Vivo a Napoli” both mean, “I live in Naples.”

You could not exchange abitare for vivere in a sentence like “Non posso vivere senza musica”, though."

Basically, you want to use ""in"" when the place has an ""inside area"" and it makes sense you say something is in it; you want to use ""a"" when the place has not a defined inside area (so you cannot say something is in it), or you use that place as a reference point, so you say something is at it.

So, while it doesn't make sense using wide regions, States, large islands as reference points, so you cannot say ""Vivo a California"", it could make sense both saying ""Vivo a Sacramento"" and ""Vivo in Sacramento"", the latter being used only if you want to stress you live in the ""inner"" part of that city, not in its countryside/suburbs.

EDIT I rephrase it.

I'm sure you never saw in your life a map where California is a point, so you can't use it as a reference point, ever.

But you saw Sacramento on different maps, and it was a point on some maps, and a region on others, so you can use it both as a reference point and as a place with borders you can stay in."

""you learn to speak in silence. When you’re drilling grammar, writing down your vocabs or listening to podcasts, you are training your speaking skills without knowing it.""

And I completely disagree with that statement, it's completely wrong. You won't improve speaking with only input and listening. It doesn't work like that, you have to speak with actual people to be good at it. 
I remember when I was learning Russian and there was this moment when I hit 6 months of consuming textbooks and media. In my head I thought I could speak and communicate without problems, but when I actually started speaking with people I understood how wrong I was. My pronunciation was all over the place, my sentence structure was unnatural and my speaking ability was overall crappy at the beginning despite having a strong theoretical knowledge. Only after I started regularly interacting with Russian speakers I noticed a major improvement in my language skills. Long story short if you want to be good at speaking, you have to speak a lot."

- truly mastering a language at C2 level

- gaming the system to get a C2 certificate

I believe you got the certificate, but there's no way on earth you could be at C2 level after 8 months starting from scratch:


- You had previous experience of taking language exams, you knew exactly what to study to maximise your score.

- Your whole study routine was optimised with the aim of passing the exam, not mastering the language. This influenced your choice of study methods and led you to focus specifically on the register and tasks explicitly tested in the exam, to the complete exclusion of things like casual, chill conversations.

- In your AMA post you also mentioned that you strategically chose the easiest of the two C2 exams. 

- Yet you barely passed the active production sections: writing (14/20 points) and speaking (13/20 points).


 
So you've passed the easier of the two C2 exams by the skin of your teeth, even after months of focusing on the exact tasks you'd be tested on. It's impressive, but it can be terribly misleading to other users, who would take it to mean that you achieved true fluency in just 8 months."

Post a video of you speaking. I’m too busy to list my arguments right now so I’ll do that after work

Edit: I’m back. After doing a quick scroll through his profile, I’m left with more questions than answers. 

For starters, he made this exact same post 2 months ago. In this post he mentions having around 800 total hours of learning. Quote: “Active was 540 hours, passive was 370 hours”. (https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1gg4xju/comment/lunkb9r/)

Well it seems like he has forgotten this, because under this thread when facing a person who criticizes him, he BOOSTS these numbers by a lot. Contradicting this own post and point. Quote: ""When I got my C2 certificate a while back I had over 2,000 hours clocked. It’s hard to believe but I put in the work"". (https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/s/Bya24DdyBQ)

This alone tells me the dude is full of it, I don’t buy any of this nonsense. 

OP also had previous experience of taking language exams, which means he knew exactly what to study to maximise his score.

His whole study routine was also built around with the aim of passing the exam, not mastering the language. This HEAVILY influenced his  ways of study and led him to focus specifically on the register and tasks explicitly tested in the exam. Ignoring things like casual, chill conversations

He also references choosing the easiest of the C2 exams and still barely managed to pass 

Ignoring the fact that a lot of what he says happened just goes against the grain of… reality! Because a C2 is NATIVE LEVEL and requires more than 1,500 hours on average. So either way his claims are not very plausible. Other commenters have already mentioned how a lot of what he says is wrong, like referring how drilling grammar improves ""speaking ability"" which isn’t true at all. And statements like this make me question if his speaking ability is even good at all. Send a video OP. I don’t say this to be mean I’m genuinely curious. 

It reminds me to what Dreaming Spanish has said. Or what Duolingo users experience. You can know a bunch of grammar concepts but the second a native actually talks to you, you’re only left with what you’ve acquired.  

Most people on this thread believe he’s just capping. Photoshop here, a little Reddit magic there. I’m in this boat too. But I’m feeling generous today, so I’m gonna give them the benefit of the doubt.

It’s entirely possible that in his studies, OP has gained a true level of high B1/B2ish. But due to him specifically studying for this C2 exam: going over questions, retaking, looking up strategies, etc, he is a case of ""memorized and preformed for the exam, left with no actual practical knowledge"". 

For you to be a genuine C2 all your skill sets must line up. All the people who replied to me saying ""he passed he must have good grammar, that doesn’t mean he can speak well. It’s an issue people struggle with"". Don’t seem to understand that if you can’t speak like a C2 or watch native movies like a C2, or write poetry like a C2, then you aren’t a C2. The real world and what a test says aren’t the same thing. It’s an impressive feat still, but lying / exaggerating for Reddit weakens this accomplishment imo, as now people are doubting your credibility. 

I will say I don’t believe OP for a second. I believe he is heavily exaggerating his stats. But he is welcome to prove me wrong by posting a video of him speaking Italian 5 minutes uninterrupted. I will say though, welcome to the language learning community

Edit: OP blocked me and now I’m unable to respond to the main post. This is just a weird this to do to delete criticism, but it is what it is. I believe I can still reply to replies here (question mark) but it’s not letting me see the overall post and other replies anymore unless I log out on web. Just an FYI.

Edit 2: Yeah ima go. I had enough Reddit arguing for the day. If OP wants to unblock me and debate like a civilized person he can, but I’m not interested in this post anymore, it’s 30 seconds of entertainment is over. Bye chat."

They speak flawless and idiomatic English at quite a young age despite never having lived in an English-speaking country, and their German is good enough to work and study in the language. I know very good English is relatively common among certain groups of young people, but mastery under OP’s circumstances is, in my experience, rare. If their English fluency is anything to go by their German must be excellent, too, and to have mastered those two languages by age 21 as a native speaker of two Slavic languages is, if nothing else, an indication of great talent.

It’s also an indication of commitment and discipline. Whatever level this person reached, four hours of daily study/practice for an uninterrupted 240-odd days are bound to have yielded results of some sort. A 240-day streak of serious extracurricular study is also not something the average person can swing. Or maybe I just haven’t met any such virtuosos of time management. 

I just think anyone who spends four or even two hours a day studying for eight months is going to get much further than the average language learner. When you combine it with talent there’s probably potential for an extraordinary result.

And to OP: congratulations on the achievement, thanks for sharing your methods, above all those relating to how you found and spent the time for/on all of this."

I enjoyed reading your two posts and all the comments you left. They're very insightful and you seem like a dedicated, hard worker.

There are obviously a lot of different factors that led to your success, as other people pointed out, like experience, discipline, and pure talent. However, something I don't see mentioned much is the fact that you found study methods that work perfectly *for you*.

This leads me to my next point. The only thing I disagree with in your post is the advice portion because it sort of reads like you are conflating what personally worked for you with universal language learning tips for everybody.

>When it comes to language learning, what do all apps, platforms, books, and even tutors promise? To free you from grammar drilling, gap filling exercises, tedious essays, etc. They take lots of time and are boring. Go ahead and do exactly those things. 

This is a good example of what I'm talking about. I recommend looking up ""bottom-up processing"" vs. ""top-down processing."" They're ways our brain processes information. Most people can do both, but there's usually one we naturally gravitate towards, which ends up influencing the methods we study with. You seem like someone who prefers bottom-up processing, and that could explain why your study methods include a lot of theory-based activities like doing verb conjugations and textbook exercises.

The people who hate these activities are generally top-down processors. They need to see the big picture and then break that thing down into smaller details. Basically, they prefer to reverse engineer a language to understand how it works instead of building that knowledge base from scratch.

Usually for these kinds of people, they do best by leaving much of the grammar stuff for later and focusing first on *experiencing* the language. They usually will consume a lot of content or even get those apps, books, and tutors who ""promise to free you from grammar drilling"" that you don't like. When they do get to studying grammar, by that point the details will make a lot more sense and they can connect the dots really quickly. They will still accomplish the same goal of mastering a language, but their path will look different from yours.

Other examples of advice that is not universal in your post include notebook vs. flashcards (this is solely a preference thing), tutor vs. no tutor (this depends on people's goals and needs), and accuracy over speed (also depends on goals/needs. I'm imagining someone moving a a foreign country but did not have the luxury to study beforehand and they need to learn the language *right now*; they would need speed over accuracy).

Like I said, it's fantastic that you've found the exact learning methods that work for you and fully exploited them. That's clearly a big part of your fast success because for many people, the process of learning a language also includes experimenting with different things until they figure out what works for them, which can take some time. It took me 10 years and a few languages, actually, though if I were to learn a new language in the future I know that, like you, I can set up a personalized routine that would give me extremely quick progress.

With all that said, there are takeaways from your post that I think everyone can agree on. We all need to get exposure to our target language in order to truly understand it. And we all need to put in the work and the time--no shortcuts!

Anyway, I hope you get accepted into the university program and that the Italian studies will pay off!"

I did a triple masters in French Spanish and Italian, which was 5 years total - 4 at uni and one in the middle in Paris. This is a UK degree, so i spent no time on other subjects like at a US college 

I had done 8 years of French at school, and was taking Spanish and Italian officially from scratch (i had done a small amount of self study).

I would say when I graduated, i had perhaps high C1 French, and either high B2 or low C1 in Spanish and Italian. 

I spent most of my year abroad failing to make french friends, so it only helped my french a little. After my MA, i moved to London and did a teaching degree to teach languages, and that year my friend group was 5 of us - me and 4 french people. I spoke French for almost 100% of my social time for a year, and i would say at that point my French reached C2 - I would not say that is a level i have ever reached for Spanish or Italian, despite my qualification and years focused on them. 

To be fair, i’ve never sat a CEFR exam, and perhaps i could pass Spanish and Italian C2, but from my understanding, it’s above me. 

As such, i highly doubt the above is entirely true. My beginners course in Italian and Spanish were very intense for year 1, as by year 2 you joined the classes of those who had done 7 years at school plus first year of uni, and I would say we got from 0 to B1 in 8 months. It took three more years full time to creep up from B1 to C1."

Is it possible to pass C2 while making grammatical mistakes and using unnatural phrasing?

1. Exactly because I had experience with language exams, I knew that the best way to prepare for a language test is to simply learn the language.
2. See above - I knew that to pass the test, I needed to master the language, so this is what I did during those 8 months. My study methods consisted of working with the textbooks (those were normal language textbooks, not exam prep books), listening to podcasts and reading magazines/newspapers (starting from intermediate levels). How are these methods not appropriate for learning the language?
3. Regarding casual, chill conversations - please take a look at the podcast list. I had more than enough exposure to casual speech, since I was not listening exclusively to news podcasts. During the oral parts of the B2 and C2 exams, I had to have a warm-up conversation with the examiner; and since the examiner was a super talkative Italian lady, those warm-ups were almost as long as the official oral exam itself. Had 0 problems with that.
4. Chose the easiest C2 exam for me - so? Does my subjective perception make CILS Quattro less of a C2 exam?
5. I'm sorry, but telling me that I barely passed the test is simply dismissive and disrespectful. In fact, there is a very good and extensive write-up on taking CILS C2 by another person (I'm sure many have seen it): [http://brianjx.altervista.org/#\_Toc415769795](http://brianjx.altervista.org/#_Toc415769795) . They spent **a lot** more hours studying than I did, and passed the oral test with ""just"" 11/20 (10 would have meant failed). Go ahead and tell that person they passed the test ""by the skin of their teeth even after studying for years"". 
6. You saw my ""low"" CILS C2 points, but ignored my result for CELI C1 (CELI is harder for me than CILS, as you might remember).

She's a C2 in Italian. If you think she isn't fully fluent yet, that's just because your definition of fluency doesn't align with the tests. Most C2 speakers will yell you they aren't close to a native speaker. But they are fluent.

Also, stop gate keeping what a ""real"" C2 is. It's a mostly objective test, and they passed it. End of story. ""Gaming the system"", i.e. prepping for the test, is what any good test taker should do.

It isn't! It's a different scale, and hours depend. An hour count isn't perfect because intensity can vary, and the distribution pattern also matters.

Drilling grammar for hundreds of hours can be an effective way to improve speaking automaticity. Not sustainable for most people but it is as it is. I love Ultimate Spanish/French Conjugation decks and the difference they make is incredible. It takes off a lot of cognitive load during listening and speaking and a conversation is these two at once.

Exams are designed to measure particular language skills in certain conditions. You can't go through C exams as you think by memorizing them etc. C2 is getting a bit fancy but it's almost impossible to statistically reliably assess the depth of vocabulary as it's too rare. C1 doesn't look that hard even. But the sheer amount of material and time limit put a real strain and you have to internalize a language to digest it effectively. That's no joke.

It doesn't matter that someone's language isn't very polished. The pass marks aren't even exceptionally high. There could be even D levels but they would be pointless. C levels mean you can take someone and put them in a certain environment and they will go OK, but some short period to adapt will be needed as other people have different accents and idiosyncracies.

Bring them back after half a year of real work and socializing in the language and there will be a huge improvement. C2 by no means is a final boss."

I would urge them (and you) to read about the US military's language school (Defense Language Institute) or follow DLI's reddit page (like I do for inspiration).


They are training people intensively and some of the students graduate at a level that is roughly equivalent of a C1 in under or just over a year, NOT in Italian (with thousands of cognates to an English speaker) but in Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Korean, etc. (And some of these students go ahead and take an advanced exam where they reach partial or full ""C2"" - in the US they use different metrics, not CERF, ofc).


And the average student - as far as I'm aware - is a monolingual English speaker with some (dormant) high-school Spanish, not someone with C2 in two other foreign languages...

How does one go from B2 to C2 in 2 months?

And specifically, how do you jump from a weak B2 level speaking (75%) to C2 speaking in 2 months? 


What is  more likely: that OP really made such unfathomable progress in just two months, or that she life-hacked the test structure to get a passing score on both exams?

Reality check: it's not humanly possible to go from B2 to C2 in 2 months, even if all you did was study all day long.

Now, consider that the speaking part is about 15 minutes long, is highly structured, you know beforehand what is coming, how it is scored and thus you can prepare in advance. How does that compare to the real-life speaking ability that challenges you on something you haven't drilled beforehand?



Even the passive tasks like reading and listening test just a narrow band of the language: the formal/ professional / academic register.

Idiomatic, colloquial speech is not being tested, so OP skipped it altogether in her studies, and focused on the ""high-brow"" register. Again, their passive understanding would falter when confronted with the language used in casual convos/ social media posts/ tv shows.

Those test result themselves tell me that OP's real actual level for active production would be closer to B1/ shaky B2 if she got hit with tasks she didn't specifically prepare for beforehand (with the exception for her passive skills: she did passively master the formal C2 register, likely bc there are a lot of cognates between Italian and English in the ""high-brow"" language - you know, from latin).

And reaching B1/B2 level makes more sense given the 8 month timeframe, and her pre-existing multilingualism. 


---

Overall, my bet is that you never taken a C2 language test, so you have a somewhat naive/idealized idea of what those exams test. I do have a C2 certificate in English (CPE) and consider taking DELE C2, so I know exactly what is and isn't being tested, and how you can potentially game the system.

It's kinda like believing: *Those two people have a marriage certificate so that means that they love each other very much.* Yeah, in an ideal world it would work like that, but pieces of paper are not always true reflections of reality.


My conclusion is that OP reached B1/b2 in those 8 months, but was smart enough to make it pass for C2 on the exam.


And my problem with OP's post is that it's misleading, leading people to believe that C2 mastery in 8 months in possible, and offering them false expectations (and some questionable advice, like not practicing speaking)."

If an individual is unable to speak comfortably and fluently while demonstrating high levels of comprehension, they will not be awarded a C2 certificate. The C2 level is akin to having high academic proficiency in a language. My main contention with the post is that achieving a C2 level in a short period is highly unlikely, especially for someone without a background in a Latin language and whose native tongue is a Slavic language like Ukrainian.

However, I do not claim that it is entirely impossible. Should she dedicate approximately 70% of her time to studying and practicing over the course of eight months, it might be achievable. Nonetheless, as an experienced language learner, I recognize that this is a challenging and somewhat unrealistic goal. Therefore, I do not wish to label her as dishonest, as she evidently possesses considerable language learning abilities and has attained a C2 level in other languages.

A native speaker could be someone who grew up speaking the language from childhood, someone who began learning the language at a young age but not as a child, or someone who is a heritage speaker. Each of these scenarios warrants different levels of language proficiency and utility. The real question is: What constitutes a native speaker? What abilities do native speakers possess that non-native speakers do not, and when do these distinctions begin to blur?

Example:

*Would an individual who began learning German at the age of 20 in Germany for five years, demonstrating minimal accent and comprehensive understanding of daily language usage, cultural aspects, formal and informal speech, and nuances, be considered less of a native speaker simply because they did not grow up in Germany? Conversely, would a late-teen heritage speaker outside of Germany, who primarily uses the language to communicate with family, be regarded as more of a native speaker due to their upbringing with the language? How would each perform on a German proficiency test?*

For instance, the average U.S. English speaker has an 8th-grade reading level. Therefore, the average native English speaker reads at an 8th-grade level. How would one compare someone who has attained a C2 proficiency level in English and possibly attends college in America to a native speaker who reads at an 8th-grade level?

If an individual manages to pass the C2 exam, they have the language proficiency to live and learn in that language using the target language itself. They can express themselves converse, read and write with native speakers effortlessly, making them a well-rounded user of the language. Comfort, confidence, and an expanded vocabulary will naturally come with time. Given that not every native English speaker uses the same colloquial expressions and daily jargon, it is nearly impossible to teach someone the entirety of the English language.

The use of the term ""near-native"" stems from the idea that one can navigate the language almost as proficiently as someone who has spoken it their entire life. I believe this is how many people use the term.

  
It is important to acknowledge that native speakers are often familiar with a greater number of words, phrases, nuances, and cultural aspects due to extensive exposure over time. However, this does not necessarily translate to a difference in active language ability, especially if one is not actively seeking to expand their vocabulary beyond what they are accustomed to. Additionally, the ability to broaden one's vocabulary, diction, and understanding of nuance is not exclusive to native speakers. While the term ""native speaker"" can be somewhat hollow and difficult to define, making it challenging to assess, it is essential to recognize the complexities and variations within language proficiency.

(In line with my previous example, an individual who grew up as a heritage speaker of German outside of Germany or a German-speaking country may lack several aspects that typically define a native speaker, such as extensive exposure to cultural nuances and a wide range of vocabulary. Nevertheless, this individual would still be considered a native speaker. This further illustrates the challenges of defining and testing native language proficiency.)



As defined by CEFR

""https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/table-3-cefr-3.3-common-reference-levels-qualitative-aspects-of-spoken-language-use""

""Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read. Can summarize information from different spoken and written sources, reconstructing arguments and accounts in a coherent presentation. Can express him/herself spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, differentiating finer shades of meaning even in more complex situations.""

I believe that you can not make a test to test someone native level , because such a test would be too open ended. But you can make a test to give someone the necessary ability to achieve that level of comfort on their own more efficiently.

As to her passing the C2 I know you said it does not concern you but she has posted proof that she has passed C2 if you were a little curious.

Although what a C2 actually implies (i. e., being reasonably fluent, being able to talk confidently about complex topics, etc.) is something you can't really infer from any reference chart, as it's highly dependent on the specific person that passes the exam, in my experience. I've met a lot of people who have passed the C2 exam in Spanish, but you would think they're only B1-B2 (!) from the way they speak. Personally, I view the CEFR as the ""lesser evil"" (as it's necessary in many contexts to have some sort of objective measure of someone's language ability), but I am of the opinion that it is very, very hard to accurately assess the full extent of someone's language level, and that it certainly can't be done perfectly through an exam."

Now is she able to speak Advance level Italian is a completely different question and I never made a statement about that. Did it actually take 8 months I don't know I don't know her personally nor do you she could be full of it. 

The post is about how she speed ran getting a C2 certificate and through her means she managed to make it happen. So the burden of proof to me was seeing the certificate.

If she said she has native like fluency in a couple months my burden of proof would've been seeing atleast a 1 hour long conversation with a native at natural speed speaking on various topics.

I personally would not do that because I actually want to learn my TL and engage with it holistically and cement many of the grammar rules vocabulary accents and so on personally I don't think language learning is a race.

And yes writing does partially train speaking assuming they have sufficient listening. It's quite well-known now that when most people read they subvocalize so it's not hard to believe that even someone is writing that are doing that too *along with recalling the words*

I know someone who learned to speak a language correctly just from lots of listening, reading, and WRITING. The person literally had to write lots of stuff daily in the other language and never had to speak it but when they do they speak very well (albeit with a very obvious accent). 

Lots of heritage speakers can't speak their heritage language because they've never needed to speak it so don't have good access to the words in their mind to speak it. The person I know has to constantly recall words because they are writing in the language all the time.

I never thought about it before OP mentioned it but I definitely think writing DOES help with speaking. I won't go so far as to say what OP said in that it's sufficient but I think it's silly to think that writing wouldn't help your speaking when the hardest parts are remembering the words you already know in the first place."

Your statement that I jumped from B2 to C2 in two months is based on the wrong assumption that on the day of taking the B2 test, I had B2 in Italian. However, on 11.04.2024, I had already finished my C1 textbook and started the C2 textbook. So to be more precise: I did not ""jump"", but went from C1 to C2 in two months. And don't let the ""two months"" intimidate you: during that time I spent 220 hours learning Italian.
2. ""Idiomatic, colloquial speech is not being tested, so OP skipped it altogether in her studies"".

4. Regarding my ""not practicing speaking""-advice: I have a story to tell here. Before I stepped on the German land, I had no speaking practice in German, apart from a school competition, a C2 exam and an online job interview. During my first year in Germany, the most frequent feedback I got from native speakers was ""I thought you were a native, just from southern Germany because of the slight accent"". So I knew I was doing the right thing with my speaking skills in Italian, when instead of spending hours on iTalki I preferred podcasts and grammar drilling."

I don't have data to back this up, but I believe that the CEFR understands a native as someone who was born and raised in the country where the language is spoken, speaking that language. But again, this is an open assumption and the standard I usually go by.

I do believe that there is a certain overlap between the skills of a native language user and those of a non-native: come to think of it, reading is probably the only skill in which non-natives can surpass the average native. It does indeed take a lot of willpower and effort, but it's pretty common in European universities to be able to work with academic-level papers in English (at least, the one where I'm at). Writing and listening are the skills in which it's realistic to believe that one can achieve, but hardly ever surpass, the capability of a native-speaker. 

Speaking, on the other hand, is the true indicator of C2 vs native-like proficiency: C2 speakers are eloquent, articulate and easy to listen to, but they're never required to match the level of spoken fluency and accuracy of a native speaker. It's an incredibly demanding task to reach the exact same level of spoken language control that a native speaker has. For instance: I'm doing my bachelor's in Germany, one of my professors has been living here for 30+ years and teaches in a very linguistically demanding field in the humanities, and she has pretty much reached the exact same fluency and idiomaticity as the average university-educated German. Still, she sometimes makes mistakes that native speakers would never make. It is of course never to an extent that compromises mutual understanding, but I think it's a pretty good proof of the fact that it is possible to come very close to a native-like level of speaking (and I emphasize that this, in my professor's case, took well over 30 years of living and working in Germany to achieve), but it's usually the only skill where C2 language users tend to lag behind. To sum it up:

-C2 reading: possibly better than a native speaker, but usually native-like
-C2 listening: rarely better than a native speaker, usually native-like or slightly below the average native (I'm talking about stuff like eavesdropping or accents, which might pose a problem to C2 language users, but not natives)
-C2 writing: very good skills, but usually subpar, unless one is specifically trained or naturally skilled
-C2 speaking: good, but not comparable to a native speaker. I got awarded a C2 diploma in English a couple years ago and haven't really had much language contact since then, so my level kinda got rusty, but I still don't consider myself more fluent than the average 8th grader. Same goes for German, even though I haven't taken a C2 exam yet (but could pass it). So yeah, C2 can be fundamentally seen as a level which, in some sense, borders the competence of an average native, but in the aggregate, it's overall still far from a native-like level.

Also, the requirements for C2 that you posted do indeed indicate a high level, but since the CEFR clearly states that C2 is not meant to be measured up against native-like proficiency, one should always compare them to the skills of the average non-native. As in: ""can summarize information from different spoken and written sources, but still not as fluently or confidently as the average native would do"".

Lastly, I don't doubt that OP has passed the exam, I just wanted to state that it was not the main interest point of the above comment. I also read in another comment of yours that you believe that passing a C2 exam is an undeniable proof of C2 language skills, but I must respectfully disagree here. It is very much possible to ""hack"" a language exam and I sadly know of enough examples of people who did so, especially with German. If you're interested in this, feel free to send me a DM.

(As far as the example with the German speaker goes, I would say that one of the cutoffs that marks the difference between native and everything else is the instinctive control of the grammar. Bilinguals or heritage speakers usually have full control of grammar when speaking, despite not really knowing why. They basically master the grammar of a foreign language to a depth that non-natives fundamentally never reach - at least in my experience based off of the heritage speakers I know)."

My personal experience and math. 8 months X 30 days X 4 hours is 960 hours. According to the FSI chart, even extremely easy languages for English speakers (Category I) require 600-750 class hours to reach **B2/C1.** Keep in mind that's **class hours**, which OP didn't take. Moreover, a lot of the time was spent on preparing for a specific test - learning academic jargon is useless for the lower levels. Normally, every class hour means at least the same (or more) amount of hours for practice at home. So we're looking at 1200-1500 hours in total to be B2/C1 (B2+). Normally, every next level requires 2X the knowledge of the previous (roughly). This makes it hard to believe that they would be at C1 at all, and the claim is they are C2.

>OP spent 4 hours a day, with probably half of that being focused on preparing for the test and test related activities, which is how you prepare for and pass a test lol

Assuming they did pass the C2 test: that's test-hacking, just like there's interview-hacking. Taking multiple IQ tests and getting ""tips and tricks"" before testing also increases your result significantly.

However, on 11.04.2024, I had already finished my C1 textbook and started the C2 textbook. So to be more precise: I did not ""jump"", but went from C1 to C2 in two months. And don't let the ""two months"" intimidate you: during that time I spent 220 hours learning Italian.


You posted you B2 exam results from April, which place you at a supposed B2 level. What does it matter what level textbook you were working on if you scored 70% on B2 grammar (?) and 75% on B2 speaking at that time? That's why I said you were around B2 in April- and that's a result for skills and register you had explicitly trained for.

Are you saying you were already at C1 level but you had a bad day and under-performed on that B2 test?


Anyway, 220h is just way too little time to jump from b2 to c2, or even from c1 to c2. And I feel sorry for people who read it and fall for such nonsense. They are up for a bitter disappointment if they try to follow your roadmap.(*)

Instead of sharing anecdotes about getting complements for your speaking, sharing your actual speaking sample from June would paint a better picture of your level at that time.

I don't want to debate all the points, and you're not the first person who gamed the system. 

I remember a redditor who got C2 in German in 9 months:

https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/s7k9li/i_have_passed_goethe_c2_in_german_after_starting/

He was very detailed about what corners he cut and how he pulled it off. He even shared pieces of his writing, which were predictably underwhelming.


I for one see a difference between getting a language certificate and truly mastering the language, and if you conflate those two things, there's no point debating it. We just have different ideas about what ""being on a C2 level"" means.


Having said all that, I didn't meant to discredit your work. You're not some total imposter, and I believe you did master some real skills in Italian.

C2 is not a measure of someone’s ability to be able to pick up on colloquial, idiomatic expressions, difficult accents, and a lot of highly specific vocabulary that comes up in day to day. Also a lot of the C2 grammar is not what’s used in conversation, the French depart in the spoken language sometimes quite aggressively. 

I will say that my experience was a young twenty something in a working environment so I’m sure someone with a C2 going to work at an embassy or something would have a much easier time."

Yeah, and you would be stupid to not do this. Preparing for a test is what everyone should be doing. They already had experience with learning 2 other languages to a C2 level - you might think they know how to learn languages for a test then.

The FSI numbers are best estimates, and likely based on people who have never learned a language before. They also aren't Gospel. Some people might need more time or less time to learn a language. Classroom learning also means slightly slower pace than what a single learner might be need. OP learned completely on her own, at her own speed, using her own optimized techniques.

>My personal experience and math.

Okay, so nothing, or you would be more specific. And I gave you someone else's experience than showed C2 is extremely doable in 2 years. Your assertion that:

>1-2 years of a language can get you to a B2-C1 tops,

Is objectively wrong. So instead of dismissing everyone else's claims, maybe you should rethink your own assumptions and reassess what you ""know"" to be true.

OP showed her Italian test dates. She went from B2 to C2 in 2 months. There's no debate here.

One could argue that achieving a C2 level suggests that mastering the daily uses of the language would likely be easier for someone with a strong ability to comprehend and speak it at a high academic level, compared to someone at a B1 or B2 level. It can be assumed that while the individual was learning French or, in this case, Italian from A1 to C2, they must have engaged in copious amounts of comprehensive input.

From my observations of placement tests, particularly for the C2 speaking sections, there are debates where nuanced and figurative speech is employed. The test taker must demonstrate comfort and a clear understanding while responding. Additionally, there are sections where one must deliver long lectures, answer questions about them, and even listen to lectures or conversations at natural speed.

While I may be mistaken, I believe that someone who can perform well in such a rigorous setting would acclimate to daily uses of the language more quickly. Although a C2 certification may not specifically teach daily slang/jargon/idioms, it serves as an objective marker of having a high enough ability to learn those aspects quickly after some practice. In essence, I am suggesting that a C2-certified individual would be a more effective user of the language overall, rather than solely for daily conversation. I hope my comment does not come across as disrespectful.

  
Edit:

I am considering this situation as somewhat akin to meeting a foreign exchange student. In my experience, I have encountered students from various countries with a very high proficiency in English, sufficient to attend lectures and take notes. However, when it came to understanding daily English slang and colloquial expressions, they initially struggled. Nevertheless, within a short period, they were able to learn these aspects quickly because they possessed all the necessary tools to pick it up easily, given their effective command of English.

I believe this is precisely what the placement exams measure (though please correct me if I am mistaken)."

No, I don't have my own definition of what C2 means.

I am comparing:

- what is the *official description of a C2 level*

- what C2 exams actually test

Believe it or not, those two things are not the same. There simply isn't enough time during a 3h exam to fully test if you really mastered the language on a C2 level. Out of necessity, the exam is confined to testing a very narrow subset of skills."

I came back for Spanish just in time for them to nuke the tree and tried adapting to the path but this along with the feeling that the volunteers and course contributors for the lessons probably weren't treated all that well is making me look for other resources to learn"

I already decided not to renew my subscription because I don’t like their business practices, this just further proves my instincts were right.

> Do you think the quality of translations will drop? 

 I tried out their ai powered ‘max’ and it was a dumpster fire so if they’re using a similar system for sentence generation it’s probably going to be a disaster. 

> if you guys are going to quit using duolingo, what are you switching to?

A year ago I bought lingodeer for Korean and mandarin, but kept duolingo for Spanish. Lingodeer also has Spanish so I’ll probably start doing the Spanish course as well."

I've had great success with Routledge books. Most languages one would be interested in learning you can pick up an Essential Grammar book as a well as a Colloquial book from Routledge and it will walk you through everything like you're taking a class, as long as you have the discipline to work through the exercises.

The missing piece is audio. You need a lot of repeated audio input to be able to listen and pronounce. And that's one of the things that Duo does provide. I'm currently not sure what to replace Duo with for the language I'm somewhat newly learning (Hungarian) because it's by far the best source of understandable audio for the level I'm currently at. Ultimately I think language-specific audio resources need to be sought out. 

Routledge books do come with free online audio but it's not enough IMO.

I'll miss doing Duolingo while I'm out on walks or waiting in lines but I've advanced far enough in Hungarian that it's become gobbledygook and I doubt that's going to get any better with this change, so I'm going to cancel before the next time I get billed.

It's a shame they could have served an Anki like purpose by leaning on the ""word practice"" section of the app but something has been fundamentally broken with that for a while. It only shows me the same 10-15 beginner words no matter how many new vocab the app introduces to me."

I am learning Japanese through English as 2nd language, and I see that certain translation, done by people, could be more accurate because they seem familiar to my native language, and therefore I know a better way of expressing that in English than the textbook suggests.

If they AI generate everything, at least they have the potential to lexically cover more of the language than the very small slice they do now but ultimately people have to align what they do with what they want to be good at, it is up to them if they want to keep practicing bland sanitized sentences over and over."

I checked their progress a couple of times and I did notice some improvements but those were far and few between.

I use chatgtp in my language studies BUT If I nask it grammar question for a particular sentence it fails about half the the time.
I am aware of this.
I think chatgtp in generating sentences by it's own when not bound to grammar limitations by the chatgtp user is of a pretty good standard. Once you impose stuff on it I want to say Y using X grammar point it often fails.
This to self correct myself and I am wary of it's proposals.

Pretty good standard is  acceptable to me. In daily conversations.  
BUT not when I am learning a language.
When I am learning Japanese, I want to phrase my sentence like the majority of Japanese people will do.
I am certain that if AI translates it won't come up with what I am looking for most of the time.

Now chat gtp and other language models (ai) have made huge progress since going public.
But at this time I really do feel that it is to soon.

So what if they kept some translators to check those translations made by AI.
I think if they do that they still don't reach the same level of capable translators on their own.

If the translator just sees the translated sentence by it's own. They just have to grade the sentence on grammar correctness.
And they will fail to say it more naturally because some sentences are made with grammar points in mind.
Chatgtp in my experience has the habit of using the same words  , when there are better words available.
There is also the question of how capable a translator is in both languages. 
I haven't asked chatgtp English grammar questions. But to me it seems that the English level is more than acceptable when trying to learn Japanese. It is that the Japanese level is not sufficient at this point.
If it misunderstands your start language. Than it might not be suitable at all to use your start language.
For example. I use chatgtp in English since I found it's use of the Dutch language lacking.


ANYWAY
I do understand the decision of duolingo to do this. But it sort of means they are cashing in.
It doesn't come across to me as sustainable.  (Subscribers will leave)
However in the next couple of years I do think AI models will do a better job than most translators.
So in order to stay ahead of the curve . I do think many businesses need to incorporate AI.
It's wrong to rely completely or mostly on it though at this point in time."

Duolingo is mass-laying off translators and replacing them with robots - thoughts?,kirkland-,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/18ueo3m/duolingo_is_masslaying_off_translators_and/,Suzzie_sunshine,"Duolingo's strength, I have found, is its presentation of grammatical constructs and repetition of those constructs. But to learn a language you need to learn to follow native conversation with reading and listening in the target language, without translation. 

So I've learned to ignore the strange translations. Trying to learn complex sentences with Duo is like trying to learn a language by memorizing a dictionary. Have you ever sat and read a dictionary?

Dictionaries are full of sentences that are technically correct but unnatural. This is the case because translation is an art, and it's its own art. And yet Duo, like dictionaries, want translations to be reversible in order to be true. But doing so destroys the art of translation and replaces it with the technicality of translation for exactitude in both meaning and grammar.

Just ignore it. Focus on the grammatical patterns, verb conjugations, and grammatical constructs, but don't try and become fluent by memorizing a dictionary or Duo sentences, because you'll sound funny, and you'll never get the flow of the target language. It just doesn't work like that.

A few minutes with Duo each day is a good thing. After that go read a book. Watch the news. Watch a movie. Find native content without translation. Because not only is translation an advanced practice, it's an art form. 

Take a look at the desktop version of Duo and get the solutions viewer plugin. Some of the most simple sentences can have hundreds of correct solutions. It's a good reference for driving yourself mad."

Only 5% of the users have paid for the subscription.

That's the acid test, if you ask me. Duolingo have successfully targeted a previously untapped segment we could define as ""leisure learners"", people who wanted to learn a little bit of a language as yet another thing to do on their phone, or about which they could brag through rankings, tournaments and the like on facebook and such.The moment you asked people for money, 95% of these people said ""no"" according to what you said, which says a lot about how serious they were in their language learning intentions.Meanwhile, people that really wanted to learn a language (and could see the value of paying for it) must have chosen something else.

It seems to me that the product-market fit of DuoLingo is that of people unwilling to pay. Essentially a ""bubble"" of make-pretend language learners that can't understand the value of education (of any kind) in their journey to fluency or that, if they understood it, decided to spend their money in other ways."

Duolingo charges based on country so somewhere in the world there are people paying the equivalent of $12 usd or less for duolingo.

This was one of my main problems with Duolingo, that they would often teach useless or low frequency words and neglect other more important and common words (and the same could be said about grammar, but it's a more complicated topic). There's an ample research into the vocabulary distribution of languages that shows that knowing only around 3k words covers around 85% of all native content (this is the figure for English and pretty much the same holds for other languages). So designing your course to target the most common words would be incredibly beneficial for learners. You can try contacting Dr Paul Nation (who is probably the world's leading authority on vocabulary acquisition) who I'm sure will be glad to offer help on this.

Another thing, please consider integrating a good quality spaced repetition algorithm to optimize the learning curve. In particular, you may try using Anki's latest algorithm (FSRS) which currently outperforms all other similar available algorithms by quite a margin. You can contact the algorithm's developers on Anki's sub.

Best of luck."

I'm C2 in two of them so there's that, but to step back -- translating foreign texts into English is the obvious way to verify this. So yes I do know exactly what what I'm talking about.

It creates the illusion of saying something when adding no information. Here it is actively the wrong word to use.

Enshittification is a useful term because it is specific for a particular process - which is a platform that serves multiple stakeholders alternately making things worse for those groups of stakeholders in a gradual process rather than doing it all at once.

It is not at all what Marx predicted would happen with capitalism, by the way - which is the compression of profit margins concurrent with the exploitation of labor. It’s a different dynamic. Marx attributes rent-seeking to the owners of established industry, not to start-ups squeezing both up and down their chains."

I'm not talking **just** about the sentences but the entire experience of using Duolingo, which can be improved a ton by improving i.a. sentences and other rigid structures (making things more personalized and more feedback-oriented). There are countless ways AI can be utilized for language-learning, and it's really only limited by how creative and innovative Duolingo wants to get.

As far as sentences go, what do you think we're dealing with here, revolutionary teaching of grammar, Shakespearean prose? 😂 If we consider the current content on Duolingo the baseline - most of this could be generated and translated correctly by ChatGPT without being validated - that's the kind of quality we're talking about here. Can translators do a better job if asked to be more creative? Yes. Can ChatGPT also do that? Yes.

Seems like you're on some personal crusade against LLMs, or simply a translator that's about to lose his job, but whether you like it or not for Duolingo's use-case (which you seem to be forgetting isn't getting you fluent but having a solid grasp of grammar and decent vocabulary) there is very little reason to keep around most of the current workforce and not be a lot more selective about what they hire people for moving forward (assuming all this becomes the reality)."

So other factors aside, your speaking and listening abilities - both measured by real, official tests - could be wildly different than the level Busuu says you tested at.

O Duolingo é bom no aspecto de conhecer vocabulário, acho que eles fazem isso de uma forma mais leve. 

O Busuu incentiva mais quanto a gramática e os testes de falar pra gringo corrigir dá uma confiança ""destrava"" pra formular frases e melhorar escrita, coisa que eu me batia no Duolingo.

Acho que compensa usar os dois, dosando conforme seu objetivo de aprendizado! :) 

(nenhum substitui imersão na língua, como ver filmes no idioma, vídeos, jogar algo, consumir conteúdo)"

Enquanto o Duolingo se baseia na mera tradução de frases soltas.

O que achei ruim no Busuu (curso de alemão):

* Lições curtas demais, muito fragmentado.
* Podia ter mais diálogos. Às vezes explicam pontos gramaticais e vocabulário sem contexto.
* Há muita religião, isso incomoda (o Duolingo também está entrando nessa). Pela quantidade de imagens que retratam uma religião, fica explícito que eles optaram por levantar a bandeira da ""inclusão"" fazendo militância e propaganda ideológica. Países seculares costumam ter leis que proíbem qualquer símbolo religioso na educação. Como podem os educadores dizer aos alunos que devem manter a religião separada da escola quando isso está presente nos materiais?! Portanto, os criadores do Busuu não seguem esse princípio básico de ensino, um antigo princípio de separação Estado x Religião que remonta ao Iluminismo. (E há estudos na Europa mostrando que banir vestimentas religiosas na educação aumenta a inclusão, liberdade das mulheres, sucesso acadêmico e profissional).

Mas enfim... qualquer um dos aplicativos pode ser um bom começo."

O Duolingo chegou a anunciar uma nova personagem islâmica pra ""inclusão"" e festeja o dia das mulheres muçulmanas.

Talvez eu perceba mais e me incomode porque, trabalhando na Europa, já tive colegas de trabalho ex-muçulmanas, mulheres que se negavam a se cobrir, LGBTs e ateus que tiveram que fugir de países como Irã e Egito para não serem mortos. Daí chegam no Ocidente... e o pessoal romantiza e defende isso. Pra quem realmente viveu sob o regime islâmico, isso é uma total desconsideração.

Mulheres são mortas por não quererem usar isso. Mesmo na Europa, muçulmanas que se negam a se cobrir podem sofrer violência doméstica. Daí colocam uma personagem bonitinha e moderna com uma vestimenta que foi criada com um único objetivo: oprimir mulheres. Por mais que tentem ressignificar ou esconder o significado, a vestimenta foi criada com essa função.

Procure reportagens da BBC sobre ""ex-Muslims"" na Europa pra ver o que estou falando."
