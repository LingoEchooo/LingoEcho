Phone bots have been around quite some time, and there are companies that use them to do this very effectively. 


Instead of using a good old fashioned Lenny type bot of loops (listening for silence and cycling thru a library of recordings), ai is using compute power to generate responses and ""think"" in real time during a call. 


At the end of the day, this increased compute power costs more, contributes more to climate change, and uses more hardware & cooling resources. 


Sure, maybe the cost of a call in comparison is negligible, but at scale the cost of implementing ai to do what a handful of recordings can is much more expensive.

This guy has been doing this with custom phone bots for a while now, too, though:



https://jollyrogertelephone.com/


He likely set up an inbound route to a queue that cycles through his different bots. That way scammers don't get the same bot each time. 


You have him host your number on his system, it filters calls based on inbound ID. Bad id's go to a bot, good id's go to your phone. 


Super simple. Not 100% fool proof, but pretty good since we have spam labeling requirements now. 


In raspbx or freepbx, it's mostly clicking thru a web interface to set it all up.

British company launches “AI Granny” that talks with scammers to waste their time.,BugOperator,https://v.redd.it/tqr8dyqde45e1,NorkGhostShip,"Plenty of scammers are straight up kidnapped by Chinese gangs operating in South East Asia, in places like Cambodia or Myanmar that have basically zero law enforcement. Hundreds of thousands of people are forced to scam people, and are harvested for organs if they don't meet their quotas. It's truly horrific.

These gangs target Indians looking for IT jobs because they know Indians speak English well enough to do the job. Shutting these factories down requires the cooperation of a multitude of governments, international organizations, and so on. The Indian government does need to step up much harder to protect its own citizens, as do many other countries, but most of all it requires the cooperation of local authorities (which often don't really exist) and the Chinese government... which has connections to these gangs and use them to do their dirty work both internationally and domestically.

This isn't crypto or NFTs, it's a real thing with measurable utility.

I literally use AI every single day at my job. It is immensely helpful for a *fuckton* of work, especially coding work--yes you have to know what you're doing to check it but AI makes things soooo much cleaner and faster. I can quickly modify and update code, or find fixes to problems I'm having, *FAR* faster than googling error messages and reading stack overflow articles.

I make dozens of queries per day and can probably quantify the immense productivity boost using these tools gives me. The tech could also definitely be *immensely beneficial* in the hands of medical and legal experts, for example, if trained properly.

That doesn't mean it's the silver bullet for every task or that there aren't huge drawbacks. There are definitely challenges ahead.

Plus it then comes with suggestions for areas there needs to have maintenance done, including how urgent it is. If it’s just worn down paint, to visible rust (where things shouldn’t be corroding), to identify structural issues on old structures. It’s insane how much it can do. Even furthermore, we made ir so smart, that combined with models and realtime weather data, it’s ages the models itself, plus highlight what certain areas of the model becomes to uncertain and needs to have a rescan.  

In short. It’s an insane tool for the service and construction teams and even I, someone who doesn’t work in those technical departments, love talking and hearing about it.  It’s a gigantic money saver and brilliant for planning stuff. Plus the sales department loves giving VR tours in them."

Scam numbers can be tracked and filtered pretty easily. You can lock down phones pretty well. I don't think I've received a real scam call in a decade. 


I have talked to Amazon, Comcast, home depot, etc. Customer service. 


Alexa is built on another ai chat service aws offers called Lex. It's intended to be a replacement for call centers, etc. 


Pretty soon you'll actually not be talking to a person at all if you need to call any company. 


Not a huge deal maybe. Maybe it means that feedback loop can be more automated idk. But it's not scammers who will be using it most because of the financial burden.

I had a call the other day asking me to give over details for my phone account. Sounded absolutely genuine, and it was exploiting a problem with online auth that a less-tech savvy person would absolutely have swallowed. 

Only minor issue is they claimed I’m an O2 customer, cos my mobile number was indeed an O2 account. 

10 years ago. I transferred networks, but their automated search for o2 customers won’t know that, so the AI got confused when I said it’s not an o2 number anymore. It then transferred me to an actual human, claiming it was the supervisor. The “supervisor” (charming chap all things considered) then asked, I explained the AI scam they’re running doesn’t take into account people who have a number that has switched networks, and to rewrite its code cos it’s easily consumed. Cue the scammer saying no no no is not a scam etc.

Any time you see a really good ad or initiative from a brand with household recognition, it's their ""agency of record"" or a creative agency doing the work for the client (the brand). Most large companies outsource their creativity across marketing, copywriting, design, advertising, communications, video, etc. to third parties that pitch them for the privelege of taking on their creative accounts.

VCCP and O2 will probably be nominated or even win an award at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity for this project, even if it's short-lived. One of the reasons they will win is that they will cite this Reddit + Instagram post (and other social media activity) as evidence that it was a successful campaign that reached many viewers. That sort of recognition is the endgame because it helps the agency win more work from high-profile clients and helps the brand's marketing department generate measurable buzz.

I've talked for hours with indian scammers. One dude called me from his private phone a few times for a week or two, to talk to me about his life.

Of course i wasted some of their time, kept like 5 guys occupied for longer than necessary and their employers didn't get any revenue for it. But these guys have like 20 other people sitting next to them, doing the same thing. And next door, there's another office, with the same amount of people, scamming westerners around the clock. I'm not delusional enough to think that me wasting a few hours of their time had any impact on their scamming business. I was just interested in what they think about it, us, why they're doing it, etc. and had time to waste.

Calling a handful of scammers with an AI is entertainment. It's not going to change anything.

That's why this granny AI thing is an ad. They even have some influencer involved in the whole thing. They're not going to call (or get called by) thousands of scammers and waste ten-thousands of hours of their labour. That's not sensible. I really really doubt that it's a thing.

British company launches “AI Granny” that talks with scammers to waste their time.,BugOperator,https://v.redd.it/tqr8dyqde45e1,Merry_Dankmas,"The big issue with it (which I'm absolutely guilty of) is the immense amount of shitty implementation it has. We all know what I'm talking about. Shitty website features, shitty Google AI summaries, shitty operating system AI, shitty AI editing software for phones etc. It's become such a hot buzzword that every company and their mother(company) is trying to cram it into every aspect they can to try and find the one that sticks. 

As a general consumer, I don't think any AI exists right now that has actually made my life better or caught my attention enough to want to use regularly. As of now, its all very gimmicky. The closest thing I semi regularly use is a music generating one and that's cause I can make all my profane and immature songs come true for my own enjoyment. But outside of small stuff like that, most widely available AI is mediocre and not worth using for more than a couple minutes. If hasn't revolutionized or dramatically changed the way that we go about our daily activities. It's just not useful enough and it's constant presence causes a strong negative connotation to many people who in turn wish it would fuck off and die.

Now like you said; it has its uses - especially in the professional world. I won't deny that. Hell, my company uses it too. It's saved me dozens of hours of reading and researching. I'm positive many businesses benefit from this increase in productivity. But that's specifically designed for that particular company and role. The AI i use for my job that summarizes thousands of pages of legal requirements between states doesn't do jack shit for anyone that doesn't do what I do for work. And that's the problem. It's truly beneficial and shining moments are behind closed doors for specific purposes - not for general use. It's great for productivity and I can see it becoming a good thing one day. But right now for the common consumer, it's become such a saturated and forced feature of mediocrity that many people, myself included, just want it to go away."

>Daisy is a human-like AI that has been developed to hold autonomous conversations with scam callers and keep them on the line for as long as possible. **The custom-built AI scambaiter has been answering calls from scammers and having lifelike but meandering conversations with no input required from her creators.**

..

>After **several weeks of taking calls** in the run up to International Fraud Awareness Week (November 17-23), the AI Scambaiter has told frustrated scammers meandering stories of her family, talked at length about her passion for knitting and provided exasperated callers with false personal information including made-up bank details. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims and, most importantly, has exposed the common tactics used so customers can better protect themselves

..

The Sims would think it's real and they're seeing or feeling, but there is no graphical world at all.



It would require simulants to be programmed to ""think"" they see things. Sims would only have to have code to think things are real time, that their senses perceive things, and that they have the ability to make decisions. 



Most simulations are just big ol math experiments, pretty much.



I think a lot of people I've seen discuss it confuse simulations for games like that, when it's not like npcs waiting for a player. It's a line of code waiting to perform an operation and feed numbers to another function."

All the articles are only talking about the AI having kept ""numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time"". I've kept multiple fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time and i'm pretty sure i haven't made any relevant dent in the revenue of these companies.

How much of these calls are they making, that it's actually going to make any difference? How much computing power are they investing in it? There are dozens, maybe hundreds of people doing this in like one building in Delhi. And in the building next door, there are just as much people doing the same thing and so on and so on.

I get that it's part of their anti-scam campaign and it's good for social media, but it's not going to change how the scammers are doing what they're doing. It might make some people more aware, since it went viral and probably reached some people who just didn't know, but other than that, i doubt that it has any kind of impact on the scammers revenue."

But I think the difference with O2’s approach is the potential scale. Unlike you or me wasting a scammer’s time for fun, they can run this AI across hundreds or thousands of phone lines at the same time. Even if it’s just a drop in the ocean, the more time scammers waste on this, the less time they have to scam real people.

You’re right that it’s unlikely to put a dent in their revenue overnight, but it does add friction to their operations and destroy their morale. These call centres rely on speed and volume to make money—anything that slows them down or increases their costs (like wasting resources on AI) hurts them, even if it’s just a little. Plus, the bigger impact might be in raising awareness.

This campaign has gone viral, and it’s probably reached people who didn’t realise how these scams work. If even a few people avoid getting scammed because of it, that’s still a win.

At the end of the day, it’s part of a bigger strategy. O2 isn’t claiming this will end scams, but combined with other anti-fraud measures like blocking transactions or educating the public, it’s a good idea. Yes, it’s also good PR for them too."

*[...] Bloomberg and the New York Times have provided more details about what OpenAI in particular is trying to get from the government: support in its quest to build data centers with power requirements of 5 gigawatts each.*

*Five gigawatts is an astonishingly large amount of power. It’s the output of around five nuclear reactors—the kind of power you need for a whole major city like Miami.*

*It’s as much as 100 times the requirements of a standard large data center. The Times reported that OpenAI’s 5GW proposal drew laughter from a Japanese official.*

*Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez told Bloomberg that he had heard Altman wanted five to seven such data centers.*

*According to Alex De Vries, the founder of tech energy research company Digiconomist, seven 5GW units would have “twice the power consumption of New York State combined.”*

*“It’s an extreme amount and, from a global electricity perspective, at that point you’re talking about more than 1% of global electricity consumption for just those datacenters alone,” he said. [...]*"

Knowing the infrastructure and what it takes to run a site like this, Altmans plan seems completely absurd. 

And for what? 
Who is gonna pay for setting up this sort of infrastructure? 
I highly doubt that OpenAI has enough investors/liquidity to sustain the build of a nuclear power plant for each site.

OpenAI reportedly wants to build ‘five to seven’ 5 gigawatt data centers — ‘You’re talking about more than 1% of global electricity consumption for just those datacenters alone’,marketrent,https://fortune.com/2024/09/27/openai-5gw-data-centers-altman-power-requirements-nuclear/,EtherMan,"So... 35GW, is nowhere near 1% of global energy consumption. We're currently producing and consuming about 20TW. 1% is 0.2TW, or 200GW. So it's 0.175% if it's 7, and 0.125% if it's 5. And considering there's already a 2.5GW datacenter (aws northern virginia) and a number of 1GW ones, it's less of a jump than you might think.

That being said... The infrastructure to supply 5GW per site isn't likely to exist. So that's going to have to be built. That's an investment for sure but also quite risky since the AI boom as it stands could pop at any moment and then that infrastructure isn't just a wasted investment, but it'll literally be detrimental to the grid in the area. So IMO, they should either have a completely seperate energy production off grid that supplies their needs (not likely), or they should be paying up front for their expected energy for a number of years as determined basically by how long it would take to fix the grid if they go away.

Large consumers already pay some of that cost for a couple of years ahead. But that should be way WAY extended for cases like this."

Car dealers will use this when you negotiate with them. People always tell you ""never accept the first offer"" but that's not enough, because the REAL trick is that the first offer cements a number in your head that you then will reference any future number against."

This is just flat wrong. Lets look at the numbers.

Worldwide consumption of power is 24,398 terrawatt-hours today. ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric\_energy\_consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption) )

Making seven, 5 gigawatt power consuming plants would be 35 gigawatts of power. That's not 1% of the power use worldwide, that's  0.143%.

The largest datacenter in the world in Northern Virginia uses 2.5 gigawatts of power. Others below it use 1.8 gw, 1.05 gw, and 876 megawatts of power. [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/top-data-center-markets/](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/top-data-center-markets/)

Making new, bigger datacenters that use more power is in line with the size of datacenters worldwide.

Power consumption, worldwide, is growing by 1.5% to 2.2% annually, more in some places as the world continues to electrify and modernize. ( [https://yearbook.enerdata.net/total-energy/world-consumption-statistics.html](https://yearbook.enerdata.net/total-energy/world-consumption-statistics.html)  )  

Lets look at what it might be like if these data centers are built over a timeline for critical infrastructure, say, a 30 year timeline typical for large buildouts, and assuming the slowest growth in power usage. That would be 24,398 \* 1.5%\^30, or expected worldwide power consumption of 34,895 in that thirty year timeframe. That means worldwide growth in the next 30 years would be 34,895 - 24,398 gigawatts, or 10,497 gw of increased power demand. These datacenters would be 35/10,497, or  0.33% of the worldwide growth during that time, and 0.10% of total worldwide power usage. Impressive? sure, but a drop in the bucket compared to the need to heat homes, clean water, power vehicles, etc.

Even if this is a near term goal, lets say, they plan on rapidly commissioning, designing, permitting, and building out these powerplants and datacenters in an unreasonably short 5 year timeframe, we're still talking 1885.57 gw of expected power growth in those 5 years for a total predicted power usage of . This would be 1.8% of the worldwide power *growth* during this time, with 98.2% for everything else humanity grows into using. Worldwide consumption of those (rounded down) would be 26,283 gw. This is still only 0.133% of worldwide power usage after deploying these gigawatt datacenters.

And these numbers assume the worst case growth. It's likely to accelerate with increased power usage for electric vehicles., which means it'd use even less."

The reality is that electricity isn't a problem. We have such an abundance of power that we often end up selling off the excess or, in some cases, literally destroying it. Power grids are designed to scale effortlessly as cities and countries grow.

For example, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Japan generates 8 gigawatts on its own more than enough to meet massive demands.

If OpenAI and Microsoft really wanted to, they could just fund their own nuclear plant somewhere. It's not as complicated as people make it out to be. The issue isn’t technical limitations, it’s that people are just being irrational or uninformed.



Edit: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant (Japan)
This is the largest nuclear power plant in the world by net electrical power. It has seven reactors, with a combined capacity of around 8 GW.



Bruce Nuclear Generating Station (Canada)
Located in Ontario, Bruce has eight reactors with a total capacity of about 6.2 GW.



Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (Ukraine)
It has six reactors and a total capacity of around 5.7 GW.

Just that releasing 1GW of heat into the atmosphere represents less than 0.0000002% of the energy the sun sends to the earth. In a nutshell, the global warming issue is actually caused by modifying the composition of our atmosphere (by adding CO2 and other greenhouse effect gases), which makes our atmosphere absorb more of the tremendous amount of energy sent by the sun. That's why we always talk about CO2 emissions, and not heat emissions.

Why is that? What technology has America used more responsibly than its competitors?  
I'm genuinely trying to think of any:

* Nuclear bombs? Absolutely not.
* Drones? I guess they innovated the first wedding shot by a drone, but just had the wrong approach?
* Social media? Hoo boy, absolutely not.
* Cybersecurity? Haha, good one—no.
* Data privacy? Not even close.
* AI/automation? Yeah... no.
* Weapons development? Spoiler alert: no.
* Oil and gas extraction? Nope, sorry.
* Hydraulic fracturing (fracking)? Negative.
* Deep-sea drilling? That’s a nope from me.
* Factory farming? Not a chance.
* Chemical production? Uh, no.
* Plastic production? Not by a long shot.
* Waste management? Ha! No.
* Online advertising? Big yikes—no.
* Personal data collection? *Laughs in no.*
* Body cameras? Nah, fam.

Ignoring the moral and social problems of a super advanced AI, if you actually follow the field, they are correct in saying we've barely scratched the surface.

There is a mathematical trend that's observable in AI, a trend that existed even before GPT-4 existed. That trend is exactly why they risked $100 billion dollars to try to find the limits of AI, and resulted in GPT-4. But now even with GPT-4, that trend still looks like there's no end.

The limits of AI, from what we can tell, is proportional to the processing power we give it with no end in sight. There has been no mathematical signs that the $100 billion servers they spent on GPT-4 is even close to hitting a wall (wall being the capabilities wall).

So the science, math, and physics is there to backup their claim that the limits of AI models can be pushed way more. Claiming doing this work won't actually improve its capability makes you lose credibility instantly, because that's actually the part that's false.

The real question here is if it's worth the pursuit. Is it really worth spending that much energy and time to rush us (humanity) into irrelevance? Or will a super AI actually be beneficial to humanity? That's the question that's actually important here.

Blue Ocean Energy Marine, a subsidiary of Dominion Energy Inc., was formed to construct and operate Charybdis to support the development, installation, and maintenance of offshore wind generation projects in the United States.

  
Without the Jones Act-compliant Charybdis, Dominion would have to construct the CVOW using a process similar to how it built its first two test turbines of the project, by staging the components in Canada before shipping them down and installing them. Or, Dominion would have had to use floating barges to carry the wind turbine components out to sea, Slayton said. 

The challenge with using the barges is they would be subject to the ebbs and flows of the sea, creating instability as the 367 feet tall turbines were constructed, Slayton added. Charybdis will instead be able to extend four legs down to the sea floor, which ranges from about 75 feet to 125 feet deep, to lift the ship above the water and out of reach of the sea’s waves.

The company said its H260-18MW model would have a rotor diameter of 853 feet (260 meters). As perspective, that rotor diameter is as long as the height of the Haliade-X, which has a rotor diameter of 722 feet (220 meters). CSSC Haizhuang said the  H260-18MW turbine would have 420-feet-long (128-meter-long) blades with a sweep area of 570,487 square feet (53,000 square meters).

Absolutely. But bringing Nuclear Energy into the tech sector (certainly not without issues of its own) moves it into that world of funny of money where 40 billion to fire up a reactor with the costs offset by ""products"" is just the cost of doing business. Whereas getting a company to drop 40 billion and spend the next 20-30 years waiting to become profitable operating solely as a utility, is basically a non-starter in capitalism.

Once enough companies are refurbing or building out, the costs will start falling and *then* we might start getting general investment in the nuclear sector"

“Has the AI bubble burst? Wall Street wonders if artificial intelligence will ever make money

New York
CNN
 — 
There’s been one big question on the minds of Wall Streeters this tech earnings season: When will anyone start making actual money from artificial intelligence?

In the 18 months since ChatGPT kicked off an AI arms race, tech giants have promised that the technology is poised to revolutionize every industry and used it as justification for spending tens of billions of dollars on data centers and semiconductors needed to run large AI models. Compared to that vision, the products they’ve rolled out so far feel somewhat trivial — chatbots with no clear path to monetization, cost saving measures like AI coding and customer service, and AI-enabled search that sometimes makes things up.

But Big Tech still has relatively little to show for all their billions spent in terms of significant revenue gains from AI or profitable new products, and investors are starting to get antsy.“

There is also a very real risk to the technicians climbing those turbines every day. Wind has the highest direct injury rates across all forms of energy production.

I’m not against wind energy, I work in the industry as an engineer. I just wish there was a focus on quality and building products that lasted rather than pumping out new turbine models like the iPhone for incremental gains while continuing to iterate on a known flawed design. Infrastructure is not a science project, most blade events are not occurring in test fields. They’re happening on active, grid-connected, consumer-paid for commercial power plants."

It is dependent on local geography and how much solar/wind is in the system.  Your mentality that it requires 72GWh per GW capacity is not universal.   Few places need 3 days worth of storage and a data center would be deliberately put in a place that gets a lot of sunshine and a lot of regular wind.   You can over build the solar/wind to allow the brief periods add more charge to the batteries.  

The difference between 24GWh and 72GWh in a place like Arizona is minuscule.  Battery prices are approaching $100M per GWh.  5GW solar, 2GW wind, 24GWh of batteries would have near 100% uptime.   The costs on all of those is less than $10B.  And most of the year this would be exporting energy to the grid vs powering the data center or charging the batteries.  

  
1GW nuclear in a western democracy is about $15B.   Any nuke ordered today will not be powering anything for at least a dozen years, if not longer.   If the AI/Cloud industry is going to run 100GW.  They are going to need $1.5T just in reactors. 

Costs matter.  The Solar/Wind Battery option is several billion dollars less than the nuclear option.  Those extra billions are paying for a tiny tiny percent extra reliability.  And they will have to wait many years before it comes online and this does not include the cost of operation.  The cost of insurance would already be subsidized by the government."

On-site nuclear wouldn't have as much of this exposure.  The idea that these sites can be ""down"" is not in-line with any major operation today, and don't think it will be anytime soon.  The workloads are quite critical, and the datacenters simply are not allowed to be ""down"".   In fact, DC uptimes are generally higher than ""grid uptimes"".   The one exception here is the AI Training machines which checkpoint and can restart.

Also, the costs of these things are evaluated mostly in terms of TCO/depreciation , not up-front capital costs.  Reactors will probably have a 40-yr depreciation schedule.  So, that $15B would be spread-out over 40 years from a TCO standpoint.  In that same 40 years, \~ $160B of server/networks hardware will run through that 1GW facility.

When sunlight hits the earth, some percent of it gets reflected back into space, and some percent gets absorbed by the ground (as heat). That measure of how much gets reflected vs how much gets absorbed is called albedo. High albedo (polar ice caps) reflects a lot, low albedo (asphalt parking lots) reflects a little. 

Solar power captures some (~80%) of that absorbed heat as usable energy. Eventually when it gets used it gets turned into waste energy (cooling a data center), but that isn't new heat, it's just that original 80% that was captured reaching the end of its usable energy life cycle (energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can exist in ordered or disordered states, and can not be returned to an ordered state once it is disordered) 

So the heat coming off of the cooling of a data center isn't excess hear being added to the system. What does matter is when we go back to that concept of albedo. 

Like I said, I don't know where solar panels sit on the albedo scale. I imagine it's pretty low, since the whole point is to absorb energy. But what matters is how it compares to the albedo of what it's being built over. You build a solar plant over an asphalt parking lot, you're capturing less heat overall, so even that cooling the data center later is still a net reduction in how much heat has been added to the earth."

In a place like Arizona where even in the winter the sun/wind is reliable enough to keep 100% uptime. 

The other solution would be to not concentrate all this in a single place and instead of a 1GW data center spread it out over a larger area with 100MW centers where any one of them being down due to inclement weather in that area is not some huge deal."

As all DC sites assume the grid will fail - and it does.  The 72hrs also assumes that the fuel can be replenished if needed to run longer durations.  I have absolutely seen this happen at very large multi-hundred MW scales - so, 72-hr is pretty nominal.

If we have built solar/wind/battery farms, then those sites must be connected to the datacenter sites through the grid - so, the above still applies.

If we found some form of combined site that included the DCs with the solar/wind/battery farm, then you could imagine eliminating the grid risk to some degree.  There would need to be enough battery to run the site for 72 hours (or maybe less depending on how often the local calculations tell you the worst-case event will last over the lifetime of the datacenter site - say 40 years or more).  You will need to be able to run the DCs and charge the batteries fast enough to handle the next outage.  Again - this would require some math based on local conditions, but common cases would require 4x the DC's ""nameplate"" capacity - maybe more.  Maybe you could get away with 3x.  So, you would need \~4GW of solar farm - which is probably about 15,000 acres of buildable land and about $5B of capital.  Solar panels last a long time, so I am going to assume we only buy this once in the 40-year lifetime window we are talking about - which is admittedly stretching the panel lifetime.

And you would need the battery plant - I'll stick with 72GWh based on actually having been in the hyperscale space for many years and understanding how they operate.  That much battery would be about $7B and take about 500 acres.  These batteries would need to be replaced at least twice in the 40-year life of a comparable nuclear plant - so, the cost would be closer to $21B (assuming recycling is free).

Solar farm + Battery farm \~$26B in this case.

If we added wind to the mix, we would have to choose some additional parameters - clearly land use would be even higher, but, maybe some of the solar could go.

1GW of datacenters would consume about 300-500 acres (assuming single-story buildings).

1GW of a modern SMR type reactors would probably take up the same amount of land as the battery farm above - about 500acres - there are lots of designs, so, not really clear here - but certainly wouldn't be the size of a solar farm.  I mean, we fit 2x300MW reactors in the belly of an aircraft carrier today.

Also, the idea of having a bunch of 100MW sites isn't really a good approach - we will easily need 100GW of net new DC capacity in the next 10 years in the US - that would be 1000 sites - which would be a logistical and operational nightmare.  The industry is constantly going to ever larger sites because of this."

The issue you brought up with renewables is that they have periods of darkness and stillness, they do,  but this is mitigated by battery storage.    The on site solar would charge the batteries during the day so even if the connection of the facility is lost, which is not the issue you brought up about being intermittent.  it would be able to keep sustaining itself with the on site solar, on site wind.   If the DC ONLY uses the grid and battery storage, then you are right, they will need a lot more battery storage but if they have their own onsite generation that can charge the batteries independently of of the grid,  then this is not so much of an issue.   If anything the main reason why this solar/wind/battery DC would be connected to the grid would be to sell excess power, which would be the case most of the time.   Hell, it would be the case at least 90% of the time.  

Arizona gets 240 hours of sunshine in December.  I am going to use 6 hours per day (which if you do the math, is less than 240 hours).  So this means that in a 72 hour period, 4GW would produce 72GWh of energy.  This is why is said 5GW of solar.   The other source, wind power tends to produce more during the winter months.   But between the three this would keep it running in December.   The rest of the year this plant would be exporting multiple GW of power during the day, every day.  

A 1KW continuous system that is only solar/wind/battery doesn't require a 72KWh battery in the sun belt.   Its highly dependent on geography, hence why I brought up building such a site in a place that has both very good solar all year long, and very good wind all year long.   This will not work as well in the midwest.   But 72x your output is not needed for battery storage in the sunbelt, hence why this is advantageous to do in particular areas.  I am in California and track our energy, we get solar power all year long, we get less in the winter, but we still get plenty in the winter months. The periods where we have major storms which drastically reduces the solar we will typically have a high wind output.  

The replacement costs for the batteries decades into the future is also likely going to be way cheaper than what you mentioned.  Costs dropped 90% between 2010 and today.  I am not saying they will drop another 90% over the next 14-15 years but today's prices are unlikely the final costs.  Likewise, nuclear reactors do not have 100% uptime over years or decades. They need to go offline for maintenance.  Vogtle has a 91% lifetime capacity factor.   If your entire operation has a single point of failure, a single nuclear reactor, it will absolutely need to go down.  Nuclear for this application also has to be overbuilt.  



  
Modern SMR reactors have not shipped commercially.  The exist for a few Navies around the world and that is about it.  Contemporary nuclear reactors take far too long to build.  A 1GW DC will not have their own working reactor for at least another 10-12 years.   They could plop down their data centers in countries that do not have such stringent nuclear regulations but this is the general timeline for every Western Democracy."

Basically it’s based on how “correctly” it predicts the next word. For example “Einstein’s first name is” should result in “Albert”. And if it gets that correctly, it’s a score of 1, otherwise a 0.

Unfortunately language isn’t that specific all the time, and there is an entropy level to language. They have calculated the entropy of language so the “perfect score” is not a 1, but rather a number between 0 and 1. The closer they get to the entropy of language, the “better” it is doing.

And the video explains how the bigger model we’ve used, the closer to that language number we get, and it scales so perfectly well that we don’t even understand the why, only that we can observe the outcome. 

It’s also why GPT-4 was a huge gamble. They weren’t sure if GPT-4 was going to hit that limit and they’d waste $100 billion, or if it continues to scale infinitely. So far, even with GPT-4, that line is still linear rather than logarithmic, telling us even GPT-4 isn’t even scratching the surface.

I know it was debated endlessly in my hyperscaler role.  Another way to look at this is if it were clearly the economical/reliable answer, the hyperscalers would already be building their facilities in the manner you suggest - they aren't stupid and have at least as many professionals in this space as any other entity.   They go through this analysis on a regular basis and understand their models very well.  Yet, the hyperscalers are pursuing nuclear and even gas generation - not massive onsite solar/wind/battery.   Not everything can be placed in Arizona.

The hyperscalers also are ""just"" connected to the grid in the vast majority of cases today, which enables them to use wind/solar/battery as long as it exists, and the transmission capacity is there.  In most cases, this will continue to be the approach for several years to come.  It is what happens next where we get into these other options.  In that timeframe, nuclear may well be here in its newer forms. 

On the nuclear front, I agree that you would need resiliency onsite - most likely 5x250MW for a 1GW load (or something like that) to handle downtimes.  These sites will also still be grid connected, so that can provide capacity in the worst-case scenarios.  Also, this will get rid of emergency backup power solutions - which is a huge win, economically, and environmentally."

This simply means that, having been refused the club, more efficient and covert methods of control had to be implemented

The same had been realized by Orwell in [a preface to Animal Farm](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-freedom-of-the-press/), where he points this out as why he can talk about certain things and not others, which hilariously was NOT published, and was only released 30-something years later."

These ghouls are not human.



""Free speech"" is an illusion if like censorship, it doesn't lead to change and justice. Otherwise, it's just yapping and tweeting in the void. When people truly want to change things, they're met with bombs against activists (MOVE bombing), riot control against protesters, billions of dollars from PAC against grassroot candidates, surveillance from undercover cops.

>There has been a widespread misconception that China operates a nationwide and unitary social credit ""score"" based on individuals' behavior, leading to punishments if the score is too low. Media reports in the West have sometimes exaggerated or inaccurately described this concept.[^(\[4\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System#cite_note-Merics-4)[^(\[5\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System#cite_note-Yang-2022-5)[^(\[6\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System#cite_note-:4-6) In 2019, the central government voiced dissatisfaction with pilot cities experimenting with social credit scores. It issued guidelines clarifying that citizens could not be punished for having low scores, and that punishments should only be limited to legally defined crimes and civil infractions. As a result, pilot cities either discontinued their point-based systems or restricted them to voluntary participation with no major consequences for having low scores.[^(\[4\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System#cite_note-Merics-4)[^(\[7\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System#cite_note-merics_2103-7) According to a February 2022 report by the [Mercator Institute for China Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_Institute_for_China_Studies) (MERICS), a social credit ""score"" is a myth as there is ""no score that dictates citizen's place in society"".

# Why China is Considered State Capitalist

1. **State Control of Key Industries**:
   * The Chinese state owns or controls major sectors of the economy, such as energy, telecommunications, banking, and heavy industries, through state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
   * These SOEs operate on market principles, seeking profit and competing domestically and internationally.
2. **Market-Driven Economy**:
   * Since the economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, China has embraced market mechanisms, private enterprise, and foreign investment.
   * The private sector now accounts for a significant portion of China's GDP, innovation, and employment.
3. **Profit Motive**:
   * The Chinese economy is driven by profit-seeking behavior, both in state-owned enterprises and private companies.
   * The state encourages entrepreneurship and competition, which are hallmarks of capitalism.
4. **Global Integration**:
   * China is deeply integrated into the global capitalist system, exporting goods, attracting foreign investment, and participating in international markets.
5. **Economic Inequality**:
   * China has significant income and wealth inequality, which is more characteristic of capitalism than socialism. The state has not eliminated class distinctions or private accumulation of wealth."

In practice, Taiwan is independent. Ask a Taiwanese.

It's all politics. They both say that but it's just words. Neither is actually doing anything about it. It allows all sides to safe face.

> And it does help manufacture consent for war. 

No, it doesn't. 

Do you think Taiwan is just going to let China take over if I stop saying Taiwan is independent? Obviously not. 

> Yes we want an independent Palestine, that's so different. Palestine is actively (and has been since Israel's conception) being genocided by israel, while there is no Taiwanese genocide. 

What do you think will happen if China is trying to take over? Taiwan will defend itself and that has nothing to do with whatever any American says. Taiwanese for the most part want to be independent and they will defend themselves against the invader. 

You are forgetting what the people in Taiwan want. For you, only Americans matter.

> There's so much difference

This is an offensively stupid thing to say.

Football has always been the most popular sport in the world, it didn't get any new attention because of Barça, if anything the sport benefited more from CR7 going to Madrid and intensifying the rivalry in La Liga and overthroning Serie A.

Also, Neymar was the greatest talent destroying every single team in the sport's greatest nation. Everybody knew he was going to be a superstar since his debut, and Florentino has never forgiven himself for letting Barça have him.

What you said is probably one of the stupidest and more tilting comments I've ever read on reddit. Like seriously man, think about what you've said. Besides that, 2008-09 Barcelona wasn't even the best version of Barça and didn't rock the world like Ronaldinho's Barça in 2006, even with the treble.

It was also during his first injury he appeared in the stadium looking like Justin Bieber and when he hosted the Game of Thrones thing.

I'm trying to say it got to his head and he started way too early with side projects and lost focus hence why talent no matter how big, is never enough.

Adel Taarabt, Sebastian Deisler(one of the earliest publically known depression cases in profession football i think), Emre Mor, Adnan Januzaj, Hakim Mastour, Xavi Simons before he woke up and locked in, list goes on

It's been a decade, i can't recall if any of those were as promising as Santos Neymar though, Götze definitely was.

Friends post pictures and you ""can't"" always ask not to.

Once you're outside you get into photos and videos very often without even realizing it, of course to link random media to name and surname would be slightly harder, but to be honest everyone's data around the internet is somuch you can't even consider disappearing.

Let's say you decide to exercise your GDPR and be deleted from everything everywhere, your photos already have been used by God knows how many algorithms and scrapers throughout the years, your name and surname appears on company data that is continuosly hacked/stolen/put online by other people that's not you, if you send CVs for a job you're also screwed unless you lend them by hand on printed paper and they don't digitalize it, ever subscribed to anything official? You're screwed. Ever subscribed to Amazon? You're screwed. Ever used cloud for photos? You're screwed. Plane tickets? Screwed. One single digital payment? Screwed. 

The examples really are too many, **if you live, you're indexed**, it's too late to defend yourself, it's completely out of your control at this point, the amount of effort needed to clean your online presence and maintain it is so much that with one wrong step you could get indexed and scraped by bots all around the world and you're no different to people who didn't care at all.

**You can't escape.**

Unless you really live off the grid, the off the grid level is ""collect rainwater"" and ""grow your food"" level, not just ""I DonT USe SOciAL MEdiA"" level.

By the way, if you only consider surface data, like the data you intentionally give, of course you can delude yourself thinking you're safe, but once you scratch the black market for data, you can throw that delusion out of the window.

Hell even by being a registered citizen in any country already puts you at risk, one single hack and your data is somewhere, just waiting to be bought and used."

To which you will reply ""so why did you have your location turned on if you didn't want to be tracked?""

See the problem yet?

Ok, why shouldn't it also display your marketing-collected data, so that the person can instantly offer the products you googled? To which you reply what, don't look at products online?  
Or, hey, why stop there, why not use that listen function our phones do behind our back? What's the problem if a person identifies you in the street, an AI lists your past 24h conversations, and said person offers you advice on how to handle that fight with your wife you JUST HAD (and stormed out of that very building, just 3 minutes prior)? Is it ok, if the person also offers a discount on that brand new dildo model the wife is secretly wanting, based on a conversation she had over phone with her friend 20 days ago?

""Hey mate I got the dildo right here in the briefcase, I know your wife wants it"" - and you cannot punch the f\*\*k because he based all this on your and hers real data.

...Now think of criminal aplications of this. Just scams would become a piece of cake.

Those photos are then fed into public databases to find names, addresses, phone numbers, and even relatives. That information is then fed back through a phone app.”"

The plot follows Robert Dean (Will Smith), a lawyer who unwittingly comes into possession of evidence linking a powerful NSA official to a political assassination. The NSA uses cutting-edge surveillance technology, including facial recognition, satellite tracking, and AI-like analysis systems, to hunt him down.

Facial recognition plays a significant role as the NSA's systems can track Dean in real-time using street cameras, traffic footage, and other surveillance devices.

Smart glasses can be built and in most developed area’s they could have a cellular internet connection. Technology to capture a face from an image, even a live image feed, already exists.

I believe Apple, aside from non public technologies used by intelligence agencies, has the most advanced software in distinguishing a human within an image. It’s apparent in their new ios features which allow you to create a sticker of a part of an image. A human is very easily “turned into a sticker”, removing all the background noise of the image. This kind of technology, and whatever aspect of it is publicly available or has an open source equivalent is what you’re referring to as “custom screenshot interface”. Implementing this is honestly the only “challenge”, but I don’t believe it will take that long to have a basic working version, sufficient to build a prototype pair of glasses.. you can always improve this at a later stage.

Uploading the images into Google Lens and capturing the results is relatively easy.

The most difficult part would have been the smart glasses’ hardware, but those have advanced so far in the past decade, I think there are zero challenges in the way of actually building the product which is seen “faked” in the video."

Turing's point was to give computer science a direction for AI. It worked. We developed language models. They're powerful. They have a lot of emergent, general abilities.

Several LLM models have passed the Turing Test, but our understanding of their real-world capabilities and limitations demonstrated that the test is flawed and inadequate to begin with. The Turing Test is therefore obsolete, but we've not yet agreed upon what's a good successor test.

On a sidenote, it's interesting how general public awareness of LLMs' capabilities and controversies have influenced our perceptions. For example, if ChatGPT had gone back in time to 2019, it'll pass the Turing Test because nobody foresaw nor understood what's coming. Today, however, you can tell a human to perform a task which involves interacting with another entity (ChatGPT) remotely via text, lie that it's a human, and not tell the human this is a Turing Test, and the human may still be able to tell this is AI. Why? Because people today have been exposed. We can tell that LLMs have a certain pattern of speech which gives away their artificiality. Back in 2019, the weirdness would've just been shrugged off, however.

There's important implications. I read an article couple months ago about this researcher whose academic submission was rejected by a journal. The reason? The researcher has such a unique writing style and choice of words that the journal's editors and reviewers concluded only an AI could have written this, because no one else writes this way. We've reached a point where AI is so good at passing the Turing Test, they inadvertently warped our perspectives into failing humans at the Turing Test."

Here's what's going on:

The Turing Test's heyday: In the 1950s, when computers were very basic, the Turing Test was a thought experiment that pushed the boundaries of what machines could do.

Limitations of the Test: As AI research progressed, critics pointed out the Turing Test's limitations. It focuses on language imitation, not true intelligence. A machine could game the system by cleverly mimicking human conversation without actual understanding.

The field moved on: Researchers started focusing on building AI systems that solve specific problems and demonstrate intelligence in those areas, like chess-playing computers or medical diagnosis programs.

The Turing Test's legacy: Though not the sole benchmark, the Turing Test is still a stepping stone. It helped establish the importance of natural language processing in AI and highlighted the challenge of creating machines that can think and communicate like humans.

If you're interested in how AI progress is measured today, there are various approaches, like evaluating performance on specific tasks or using benchmarks that measure an AI's ability to learn and adapt."

Producing something that can convincingly ""imitate"" a human in a context-free, isolated conversation of no more than a few minutes is not *that* hard, especially if you play the Turing Test via the rules of normal communication.

Deliberately being weird or deviating from standard conversation still catches out a lot of chatbots, though.

The point of the Turing Test though, wasn't to be some measure of whether an AI was real, it was more posing the question ""how do we test for intelligence in machines"" and offering one possible idea. It was never meant as a definitive benchmark.

The main strategy of that chatbot was to ask questions. People testing the bot would answer those questions, and it would ask new questions. This way, the testers were so busy with answering questions that they forgot to ask questions, and therefore they couldn't tell whether it was a bot.

It’s more about how general it’s intelligence is at this point. I think people tend to conflate “intelligence” with “consciousness”, but a system can be intelligent without being conscious.

Because the models were intended to fake it.

I think that's what the early test concept didn't consider.

Also:  The model isn't really the A.I. in the way we think of as functional or active intelligence, it's just a very complex database where inputs are worked and reworked and checked, with variance added via prompts and seeds, and a result is spat out.  If you keep the exact same settings and inputs, the output is reliable.

In a way, the A.I. is the what made the model.  That is where the ""training"" or ""learning"" took place, which would be the potential sentience or thought.

The AI is really good at synthesizing information, but it is bad at other things. I remember reading stories about how Einstein couldn't dress himself very well, putting on different color socks and the like.

The goal is to guess if the PERSON in the imitation game is lying. It sets serious boundaries on the acceptable methods to determine if it telling the truth since the goal isn't really to hide a fake storyteller, the goal is to hide a fake person telling a fake story.

They haven't passed the Turing test yet. There's no time limit on the Turing test, afaik. The goal posts haven't been moved. Though I have set an arbitrary bar for myself -- three days. If I can engage with an AI for three days and it still fools me, then I'm throwing in the towel. 

I don't know how many years it will take to reach that point. But I don't think that your example is going to hold up very well. (Care to make a side bet on whether chatGPT 5.0 can solve it?) You can pick at a similar flaw in ChatGPT by asking it to play a game of 20 questions. That's easy for a human. It's even easy for an algorithm designed to do it. I used to have a hand-held toy that could play 20 questions --- 20Q, first produced in 2003 --- that could play very competently. But ChatGPT fell on its face after about 4 questions. It physically could not follow the logic.  

Now, it might be hard for a LLM to solve these problems. But it's not impossible. The brute force solution would be to ask the LLM to write code that solves them. That would probably work.

But I don't think it'll come to that. I think the next step will be expanding the AI's memory. Allow it to take notes. Right now, chatGPT seems to hold the entire prompt in its machine learning algorithm matrix (""mind"" for want of a better word) and then compose the answer linearly, bit by bit. 

And that's just a terrible approach for these kinds of logic tasks. It's garbage for writing poetry, too. 

But what if the AI didn't have to hold the whole thing in its head all at once? What if the AI could take notes? What if it could draft its answer and revise it? What if it could take the prompt piece by piece? 

Those don't sound like challenging things to implement. And even if they are -- playing the game Go was challenging. Passing the bar exam was challenging. Predicting protein folding was challenging. Image recognition and generation was challenging."

But that's not what we do, we either ask for something you can simply look up, or we ask for something inane for which any vaguely answer sounding thing fits well enough. We don't ask for things that would be actually useful to solve.

This is pretty clearly a revisionist interpretation. The original proposed purpose of the test by Turing himself is to measure the ability to display intelligent behavior, and the test has been criticized by philosophers for how well it can do so. There wouldn't be that kind of criticism if it was only intended to show how hard it is to evaluate intelligence.

Your statement applies more to Searles's Chinese Room thought experiment, which reformulates the Turing test to show why it is not a very good measure of intelligence.

Turing equated the ability to use language and the capacity for deception to intelligence, or at least assumed that intelligence was a prerequsite for these things.

However, the chinese room theory proved that the ability to use language is not a function of intelligence, nor is the capacity for deception predicated on intelligence. It did this by proving that humans aren't actually that hard to fool. And also by proving that it is possible to learn a language without actually understanding it.

All the turing test is capable of actually proving is that a machine can learn language and that it can lie convincingly. Not that it is intrinsically intelligent.

What causes the misunderstanding is the broad assumption that one man's definition of machine intelligence and his prescribed test for it is flawless and above criticisim.

It *is* a test to prove intelligence, according to alan turing's specific definition of intelligence."

It's worth noting that the test was devised on the presumption that there would be outliers and that even ""good"" machines would not have a 100% clearance rate vs. interrogators:

>I believe that in about fifty years’ time it will be possible to programme computers \[to\] play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent, chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.

If you have 99.999% of interrogators saying ""that's a machine"" and one complete nutjob saying it's human then it failed any sensible interpretation of the turing test.

The issue with the turing test is, to me at least, that it doesn't define any prerequisites for the interrogators. There's also an incentive for businesses or even researchers in some context to water it down or dramatise the test to gain attention.

With a strict interpretation of the test no modern day LLMs come even close to passing, especially if said test dictates that the interrogators be versed in a relevant field."

To be fair, that was kind of the whole point of the Turing test already. So in that sense, people just moved the goalpost because they don't like the idea that what we call ""intelligence"" or ""consciousness"" is actually much simpler than we'd dare to admit and even worse, something that can be faked convincingly. Humans just like to put their own mind on a pedestal. People used to deny that black people could be as intelligent as white people. They also used to deny that any computer without human level intellect could beat a human in chess. And now they used to deny that talking and expressing emotions like a human was possible for something that is not human. Whatever ""test"" of ""intelligence"" they come up with next, it will be just as meaningless. Every time people get proven wrong, they just move the goalposts to keep their feeling of superiority.

The big questions are: how can you lie convincingly without thinking ? How is intelligence qualitatively different ? Are we doing something more than the computer does ?

IMO, the Chinese room thought experiment is just a misunderstanding. It confuses hardware and software. It tries to prove that since the hardware (the people applying the rules) does not understand Chinese, then there is no thinking involved.

There's a world of difference between what modern software engineers call ""AI"" and Turing's thinking machine.

AI in it's current iteration doesn't think, it's deaf dumb and blind. What AI really is, is an automated statistical analysis married to a google search. Statisticians have done the same analysis for a very long time in software, it was just a lot more manual and slow. 

Fact of the matter is that 99% of human conversation and language follows repetitive patterns and rituals. e.g. that slightly awkward ""How was the weekend Bob?"" icebreaker in the break room as you wait for your coffee to pour."

Basic chatbots have indeed been around for a while, but the capabilities and sophistication of modern AI like ChatGPT have taken it to a whole new level.

What's fascinating now is the accessibility of this technology. As you mentioned, it's no longer confined to the realm of expert programmers. Now, anyone with basic technical skills can leverage AI to create art, music, literature, and more. This democratization of AI opens up endless possibilities for creativity and innovation.

However, it also raises important questions about the authenticity and reliability of content on the internet. With AI-generated media becoming more prevalent, distinguishing between what's real and what's fake can indeed be challenging. But as you rightly pointed out, this has been a concern even before the widespread use of AI. The key now is to adapt and develop new strategies for navigating this evolving digital landscape."

I mean I know everyone uses AI to describe all the machine learning algorithms that have created chatGPT and all that but they're anything but intelligent. They're just basically the same chat bots we've always had just with access to more data to train on and the ability to generate images as well as text. They can't solve complex problems, they don't actually create anything unique, they can't make any meaningful decisions outside of what we program / ask them to do... all these ""AI"" programs people are worried about are just glorified predictive text generators.

I would argue aside from creating fraudulent content to scam people and a few very technical applications we haven't even found a good use for it yet. All the ""creative"" content it generates is largely garbage because it is, by definition, derivative and hacky. Most of the consumer-facing tech labeled ""AI"" is either janky or requires so much fine-tuning by an actual human to be useful that it defeats the purpose. I mean where are all the TV show and movie scripts created by AI that are supposed to put writers out of work? Where's all the automated restaurants that were supposed to pop up everywhere? (Most of the ""AI"" restaurant BS has more to do with robotics than machine learning anyway. Everything I've seen is ""here is a robot that can make a hamburger and oh also the menu can predict your favorite order that you may or may not want to actually order."" cool?)

I think the most frustrating part about AI is how disappointingly lame it is in most applications and how people have bought in to the tech bro hype so hard we're getting shower thoughts bemoaning the end of the world even though it can barely write a book passable book report.

These LLMs are literally reasoning about reason.

Pretty sure this exact argument is the crux of why current estimates for the date of AGI, even among the biggest experts in the field, vary from 1 years (Musk) to 5 (Open AI) to something like 500+ (Chomsky).

In some sense it's very much a question of ""What do you think 'think' means?""

My gut says that if the 1-5 end was correct then we'd already be in a very literal arms race with militaries funneling trillions per year into proprietary models trying to get an edge, but who knows man? Funding would have to come from a bunch of old men who think the internet is a collection of tubes after all.

EDIT: For poli-sci nerds, if Chomsky seems like a weird reference here he's basically been considered *the* guy for language models and artificial grammars within CSC for the past ~50 years. He's super old-school but his arguments are very sophisticated.

EDIT2: For everyone else, if Musk seems weird he's got loads of insider information and a congenital inability to keep his mouth shut. I think he's probably more trying to move the needle on his OpenAI suit, but I don't think he can be completely discounted either. Especially given how OpenAI seems willing to stipulate on this and well... just how f'ing good Claude Opus is. Thing can write so much better than I do it's crazy. Seriously! Just write a chapter or two then ask Claude to act as your editor and rewrite the chapter following all the chapter beats strictly but rewriting in the style of like a Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett or someone. By the second or third draft it looks scary good. Thing 'understands' humor! You know how hard that is even for humans that are simply speaking a second language?

EDIT3: This was also the model (iirc) that when they were conducting retrieval testing asked it to find a ""needle in a haystack""--some obscure bit of trivia that was mentioned only once in the data, and the AI came back not only with the data but with a joke about how ""there's no WAY that data belonged there...

> The Turing test isn't about putting someone in a room and telling them they are participating in the Turing Test.

Yes it is. In Turing's own words: ""The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the ‘imitation game’. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either ‘X is A and Y is B’ or ‘X is B and Y is A’. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:

(text snipped for brevity)

We now ask the question, ‘What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?’ Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, ‘Can machines think?’""

These LLMs are literally reasoning about reason.

They can't do this, actually. They actually don't ""know"" anything.

They produce ""plausible"" output but they don't actually understand what that output means. Any ""reasoning"" from them is just the same thing (which is why their reasoning is often illogical/self-contradictory) - it's not actually cognizant of its output.

This is why it will happily tell you what Disney's profit margins were in 2030, even though that's not information that exists (yet) - because it is just generating a plausible report based on data that is in its database (the last time I did it, it was a garbled mix of previous quarters of Disney financials).

Chomsky isn't an expert in the field.

And the entire notion of AGI is flawed to begin with.

The idea that we're close to intelligence is because of people who don't understand these systems. Nothing we've done with ML has actually resulted in intelligent output.

Well it's a *very* active area of research obviously (Just look at the past 2-3 ACLs) and you're absolutely correct that under the Chomsky criteria AI **can't** reason... but that doesn't change the fact that pretty much anything post GPT4 Turbo is already proving to be very good at providing a rational sounding reasoning to its steps in situ before generating final output and with minimal hallucinations.

You're also correct that the technology is *incredibly* young and even in the most advanced models there are still real issues with the technology... but I'm going to have to disagree that ""they can't do this"". Many models are already incorporating it.

> Chomsky isn't an expert in the field.

Stating that Chomsky isn't an expert in the field of generational grammar is of course ridiculous. I assume you mean LLMs more specifically, and if you've got a problem with his logic surrounding the implausibility of developing an algorithmic solution to the ""pruning"" problem created by the fact that humans automatically ignore 99.9% of all grammars then join the club, but he has literally been one of the leading expert on this stuff since the 60s and his arguments are very good.

>The reality is that ML systems aren't really useful for things that have to be reliable because they're statistical models.

Sure. So are humans. I don't trust myself to calculate a complex series of integrals or Hamiltonians, I use a turing machine for that. Because I **know** humans are imminently fallible. This is the same as I'd expect from anything approaching a sapient AI.

NOTE: Just to clarify what is being talked about, the models that most people would have had access to even just 6 months ago would consistently fail even the most basic of logic questions such as ""What is one plus negative three?"" They literally had no concept of reasoning. [Now some ""do"" and they're perfectly capable of generating formal and even *novel* proofs that they are correct...](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03241.pdf) while still occasionally being completely wrong about it. Go figure.

Does that mean that ALL of those ""proofs"" are meaningless hallucinations with no grounding in logic, or does it simply imply that like Humans, LLMs are also capable of making mistakes? This is where the ambiguity lies.

Personally, I'm of the school that believes that any model that relies on being wrong in order to learn from mistakes is inherently fallible and will ALWAYS make some level of mistakes, but I fully acknowledge that there are other views on this as well."

Being indistinguishable from a human in careful conversation is a *very high* bar to pass.  LLMs have made great strides there and *may* be close to passing that if improvements continue at the current rate.

It seemed in Turing's time (and even five years ago) that passing that bar would require human-like knowledge and understanding, or at least something similar enough to be important.  The interesting things that LLMs have shown as is that that doesn't necessarily appear to be the case anymore.

LLMs selectively regurgitate in such an advanced way as to make it seem as though they understand things and make it seem as though they produce novel thought.  They clearly lack comprehension of what it is they're talking about though.  Are human's just regurgitating in a more advanced way?  Does understanding come from just connecting enough words together until you hit some critical point?  Does intelligence comprise some further aspects?

The point of general intelligence, and what most people mean when they think of ""intelligent"" AI is an intelligence that is like human intelligence at least as far as it is conscious and and aware of the decisions it makes and why it makes them. That it *experiences* reality.

You can't just say that machine decision making has that sort of intelligence, or you start having trouble defining why an animal can be intelligent, but a plant, or even a rock, cannot be. (Both respond to ""information"" or inputs and result in changes.) And if a tree is intelligent, then what even is it?

So when most people talk about AGI, they are talking about human-like or sapient intelligence. But ""sapience"" just means to have human-like intelligence. They are generally unsatisfied with machine intelligence because machines are not aware of the self, nor do they have a theory of mind.

But we do not know what sapience really is. Or why we even have it. We do not know what the difference is between consciousness and unconsciousness is on a philosophical or chemical/engineering level, we can just see the changes in the brain activity when they happen.

Whether that goal is even meaningful, or something we want to actually attain, with machine intelligence is another question, but dissembling by equating machine learning with sapience just confuses people and makes them think that LLMs have sapience, or human-like intelligence, when they really do not."

They still hallucinate and fail basic tests of reasoning.

> You're also correct that the technology is incredibly young and even in the most advanced models there are still real issues with the technology... but I'm going to have to disagree that ""they can't do this"". Many models are already incorporating it.

Many models are trying desperately to paper over the hallucination problem.

The problem is that the entire approach is flawed.

> Stating that Chomsky isn't an expert in the field of generational grammar is of course ridiculous. I assume you mean LLMs more specifically, and if you've got a problem with his logic surrounding the implausibility of developing an algorithmic solution to the ""pruning"" problem created by the fact that humans automatically ignore 99.9% of all grammars then join the club, but he has literally been one of the leading expert on this stuff since the 60s and his arguments are very good.

Faking comprehension of grammar doesn't actually require you to understand grammar, it just requires a significantly robust data set and statistical inference.

The LLMs are entirely capable of producing grammatically correct sentences most of the time.

> Sure. So are humans.

Humans are made of carbon.

So are diamonds.

Therefore, humans and diamonds are the same.

Figure out why this logic is flawed, and you have the answer.

> Just to clarify what is being talked about, the models that most people would have had access to even just 6 months ago would consistently fail even the most basic of logic questions such as ""What is one plus negative three?"" They literally had no concept of reasoning. Now some ""do"" and they're perfectly capable of generating formal and even novel proofs that they are correct... while still occasionally being completely wrong about it. Go figure.

The success rate is south of 50% and they failed to do the obvious experiment (re-test on a totally different data set of proofs), which suggests that they performed the obvious experiment and it failed, which means it didn't actually learn reasoning at all, it just is faking it in the same way that it fakes language proficiency.

You can train an AI to ""solve"" a lot of seemingly complicated problems, but this isn't actually that exciting once you understand how they work and once you realize they're working via statistical inference.

> Does that mean that ALL of those ""proofs"" are meaningless hallucinations with no grounding in logic, or does it simply imply that like Humans, LLMs are also capable of making mistakes? This is where the ambiguity lies.

No, it's not. The reality is that these models aren't reasoning. Once you understand how it is that these models function, you recognize that on a basic level they're not actually behaving in an intelligent fashion at all.

The reality is that the kind of statistical models that these things are can be useful, but they're not going to be intelligent because that's fundamentally not how they are created nor how they function.

> Personally, I'm of the school that believes that any model that relies on being wrong in order to learn from mistakes is inherently fallible and will ALWAYS make some level of mistakes, but I fully acknowledge that there are other views on this as well.

Whenever this conversation starts up, the default assumption seems to be that sentience == intelligence. I just don't see that because, as you said, there's clearly a continuum of both. We can assume our human experience to be the archetype of sentience, but where does a dog fall on the continuum? What about a fruit fly? 

Personally, I simply can't couple the two concepts together in my mind. Intelligence is simply being able to store and manipulate knowledge. Knowledge, as far as I can understand, is just any information that has an associated metadata structure that vouches for it's veracity. Example: I know a given message is correct because I have verified it's CRC. If a computational platform can perform that task and make decision based on the conclusion it draws, then by definition it has demonstrated a level of intelligence. 

This is completely separate from whether a system can acknowledge it's existence or prove that it's aware of the world around it - which is the issue most people seem to be talking about when they mention AI. 

From my perspective an LLM is actually an intelligent system. It's just not sentient because, well, why would it be? A human isn't sentient just because it can talk and plenty of animals are probably sentient while having no speech capabilities. Sentience and consciousness appear to me almost like a supervisory task for a number of non-sentient, yet intelligent tasks that our brain performs. 

The way I see it is that, in order to ever achieve artificial sentience, we have to break down, understand and recreate each of the tasks that work together to create the basis for sentience, like language models or visual classification systems. When we have these working well then we start looking at running an artificial supervisory task that reconciles their individual outputs to create and *experience* or awareness, or whatever we want to call it."

> The LLMs are entirely capable of producing grammatically correct sentences most of the time.

The problem with the ""pruning problem"" isn't that ML can't emulate a human, it's considered the core reason that they can require millions of hours of footage to tell a dog from a cat, where a human four year old who's never seen either before can tell them apart almost immediately.

It's considered a main reason LLMs require millions of dollars worth of compute to learn what a human brain could from a tiny fraction of the data on less than a kilowatt. That's why Chomsky's date is so far out there... he thinks to 'beat' a human generally an LLM would need a level of compute and data that we won't have for generations and that it would need to be trained in an environment where it had full access to the breadth of human senses and human-like experiences.

> The success rate is south of 50% and they failed to do the obvious experiment (re-test on a totally different data set of proofs)

This is untrue. Final check of Loop was tested on a subset of 2,000 problems out of Flyspeck when it had access only to data generated from Core and Complex. It closed 37% of those on first pass. It's total solve rate across the entire data set was actually 58%.

> People have used ML to solve games, so this can't actually be true.

Games can only be ""solved"" if the entire state-space can be traversed which hardly requires ML. What learning techniques can offer is functionally the same thing that the scientific method offers: asymptotic improvements over time.

Stockfish will always get better at chess right up until the moment it has ""solve tables"" for 32 pieces... exactly as it is today for anything with less than (iirc) 9. At that point you could fight Stockfish v. Stockfish with one getting only 1+1 second and the other given unlimited time and there would be no difference between them whatsoever. The game becomes O(1).

The ""there are other schools of thought on this"" comment was not meant to imply there was any debate about how this process worked, but rather a nod to the fact that many people don't WANT their machine to go against direction, to conflate opinion or even fantasy for fact (or maybe even have imagination at all), to lie to them, to ask questions they don't need the answer to, or to [EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!]. 

Some of these examples are literally 'tests' that have been used in the past to 'prove' *lack* of sapience (...in Chimps and Gorillas. Train them for sign language and they'll never once ask 'what's the sign for ___'? or any other question. They only answer directly with the response they think is (statistically) most likely to get them food. Sound familiar? That's our cousins. LLMs already smoking them in some respects.)

Not everyone's trying for the same goals here and NO ONE really has a good definition for what the hell 'intelligence' means outside of vague descriptions like it being ""an emergent property of sufficiently complex systems"" or ""I know it when I see it"" or whatever.

If all I was concerned about was cheap labour or something then I'm not sure if that definition even makes much of a difference, since ""AGI"" is hardly a requirement for that. If anything, I'd consider it a negative. Personally, I'm far more concerned about the opposite side--What should we do if we accidentally create a model that IS fully sapient... but not *humanly* intelligent.

An ""Artificial Alien Intelligence"" if you will.

What is the morality of turning such a machine off without permission? Of deleting it? Or simply of deleting part of its memory? But again, none of this is my specialty. I do, however, think it's something that we should at least be on the lookout for and I *don't* think our metrics to test for such a thing are very good right now. Or even existant.

We know human beings have the ability to know things, right? What does knowing mean though? To know is to be aware of a certain information. To not know is to be unaware of this information. If I am aware of the solution to a problem, then I know how to solve it. If I am not aware of the solution, then I don't know how to solve it. To be aware of something means that you are conscious. You cannot be aware of something and be unconscious. 

Calculators, thermometers, books, Chinese rooms don't have the ability to be aware of information. They can contain information, store it, measure it, even generate more information. But they can't know it. Therefore they aren't conscious. 

Unless you prove to me that thermometers and Chinese rooms are conscious of the information they contain, I won't change my position."

E.G. If I put a ball at the top of my stairs, and say that means ""1."" Then I say that any balls at the bottom of my stairs mean ""0."" I then push the ball down the stairs.

In that instance the ball stored information (its locations) and manipulated information (changing 1 to 0.)

How is that meaningfully different from how binary works? In theory, I could easily build a complex machine by imputing power that would be Turing complete only using the location of balls and where they move.

It would be absurdly slow of course, but this is exactly the premise behind water computers, and even normal computers themselves, as 1 vs 0 is just a state of high vs low.

But why does it need to even do calculations? Why do I even need to define which side means one and which side means zero? It is fundamentally the same regardless. A rock stores the information of where that rock is, what shape it is, what it is made out of, etc. And if any of those things change, the information has been manipulated into a new result. If, when rolling down the hill it strikes another rock, it now has an input and makes a decision in *exactly* the same way that computers do.

So a definition of intelligence that is purely based on information and it changing/making decisions does not result in a definition of intelligence that does not just apply to everything.

LLMs are balls rolling down the stairs, but there is a complex series of moving objects responding to other input on the way down, but all of those are just caused by balls rolling down other sets of stairs. The only difference is how we, as humans, interpret the results. It is our relation to the thing that allows us to draw the line of where intelligence is and is not. It is our observation and definition, not the inherent complexity, that makes the difference.

Which is why people rarely mean that when they say ""intelligence."" They mean sapience. What they want is a machine that can define itself as being intelligent, and experience what that means."

What you're describing is the only metric we have for measuring computational capabilities. It sounds silly, but physical interactions that are given context are all that information is. The metric is bandwidth, or how much contextualized information can flow through a system over a given period of time. Once it reaches a certain level of complexity we can call that intelligence sentient, but it was intelligent long before it ever reached that level of complexity.

I still am just using the dictionary definition of intelligence: the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. 

The key word here is knowledge, not just information. By this definition sentiency is not tied to intelligence really at all, most of what sentient beings  ""know"" is not knowledge but belief. Holding a belief is something our consciousness does based on information brought fourth by the unconscious tasks   that are constantly running in our mind. 

Beliefs only become knowledge when verified by a circular algorithm that compare information against axioms that have been set up as references to truth(if A=B and B=C then A=C). That's essentially what science is and that's reflected  in the etymological origin of the word - sceinta( Latin: to know). The same algorithm that scientists use to prove truth is implemented in non-sentient recursive estimation algorithms to approximate truth (things like real world values) and they can determine truth while bypassing the need for sentience altogether.  

Sentience itself, while a cool topic and an interesting goal of intelligence development, does not define intelligence. The proof is that sentient beings are more often than not very dumb.

Edit: to clarify in a different way: your brain is a computer, it is intelligent. Your mind (or consciousness) is a construct of your brain and harnesses the intelligent computational abilities of your brain. It may tell your brain what to do, but it's really not doing the work, the inanimate hardware that is your brain does the actual ""thinking"" just like a conventional PC crunches the numbers in your Excel sheet."

We can measure how intelligent a person or a machine is. You can't (yet) measure how sentient something is. Sentience may be influenced by intelligence, but they are not the same thing.

But tell me more though. Are there really molecules that have a built in system that confirms the veracity of their informational content? If so, I would consider that system to have a non-zero measure of intelligence."

Knowledge, in specific, refers to *awareness* if information, or the *experience* of information. Which means it requires the thinking thing to be aware or to experience in order to have knowledge.

Again, using the rock as an example, a rock has the information about its entire being stored in it's being, but it is not aware of that information, and so lacks knowledge about itself.

You cite the dictionary definition of intelligence here, so I will do the same for knowledge, this is from Merriam Webster:

>the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or association.  
acquaintance with or understanding of a science, art, or technique  
the fact or condition of being aware of something  
the range of one's information or understanding  
the circumstance or condition of apprehending truth or fact through reasoning  
the fact or condition of having information or of being learned

You will note that while the colloquial definition is a little vague with regard to the meaning of information, all portions of this in some way reference an awareness or understanding of information.

From a more specific standpoint with regard to the philosophy of science, knowledge of this sort is a ""Justified True Belief."" Meaning it is something that the possessor is aware of, holds to be true, and is justified by fact. (Belief being a subjective state of mental awareness holding some idea to be true.)

There is a fundamental difference there. I am not arguing that making a machine that is aware and has a theory of mind is impossible, nor am I saying that such things are inherently non-physical. (It is almost certainly only physical.) I am saying that they are a qualitative state that man-made machines have yet to attain, and that people seeing a difference between a rock, a calculator and a brain is justified."

Why do you assume consciousness is something you can program? 

>There are only 2 possibilities: either determinism is correct and all things are simply the result of the forces of nature and prior causes, or there is magic.

Just because consciousness doesn't conform to physicalism, that doesn't mean consciousness is magic. Maybe physicalism is wrong. If our previous knowledge doesn't match with new discoveries, we need to re-evaluate our previous knowledge. Imagine if people deemed Quantum Mechanics as magic just because they don't conform to the same laws like Classical Mechanics. 


>There are interesting questions as to whether consciousness is a necessary condition of a certain level of cognitive functioning, but at the end, consciousness is either a natural process driven by complex physics or it's magic.

Intelligence doesn't require consciousness. We can create a highly advanced robot that is highly intelligent, capable of acting like a human being. All this without giving it a consciousness. A consciousness is unnecessary. The robot doesn't need it to perform any of its tasks.

Human consciousness is not an emergent property of the brain. Consciousness is fundamental. The brain shouldn't even need consciousness to function. Evolutionary speaking, there is no advantage to having consciousness as opposed to thinking mechanically.

Half true, machines can have information AND knowledge. This is proven by the fact that humans, which are machines, can have knowledge. A kalman filter has knowledge of the state it is measuring because it references each new data point against an expectation of what that new data point should be and then in turn uses that conclusion to influence further decision about its faith in it's prediction. I would call that an intelligent system that has no consciousness.

My problem with Webster's definition of knowledge is summed up in the concept of ""justified belief"". If you believe something that is not true OR believe something that is true for the wrong reasons then you are missing knowledge, or you have false knowledge. If your experience is not based on truth, then you are not intelligent (not you specifically, but anyone). This fact alone is what decouples the concept of intelligence from sentiency and makes them into two separate items for discussion.

I'm reiterating that I believe knowledge to be information that is verified against an external axiom (see the relationship between science and knowledge). I'm saying that ""justified belief"" is not knowledge, but just information, and a system that bases decisions on that is not intelligent. I reject Merriam Webster's definition on that basis and I think it would be better if they used that definition for ""belief"".

(There are other forms of knowledge, but they are increasingly reliant on subjective experience.) 

If you strip the need for knowledge in intelligence, then it is just possessing information. And if it is just possessing information, then all matter and energy in the universe is ""intelligent."" 

Here is the introduction to the Wikipedia article, as an example, emphasis mine:

>Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It can be described as the ***ability to perceive or infer information;*** and to retain it ***as knowledge*** to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.

And here is the article on knowledge:

>Knowledge is an ***awareness*** of facts, a familiarity with individuals and situations, or a practical skill. 

The reason AI stands for ""artificial intelligence"" is because it is literally *artificial.* It is not artificial because it is made of objects, all things are, it is artificial because it is only designed to appear intelligent, not to actually be intelligent.

Again, the end result of stripping the requirements for awareness from intelligence is just that the word loses all meaning. It would apply to all objects and energies that can be measured. The book I was just reading would be intelligent because it was communicating ideas to me using actual language. We can describe AI as all sorts of things, like being useful, complex, fast, whatever, but it is still artificial. 

So when people ask if AI is intelligent, they are not asking if AI is able to calculate results from input or create patterns that we recognize as useful, everyone already knows that computers do that. We interact with them constantly. They are asking if the AI has a mind that *knows.*"

No it's not. You don't know anything about whether a machine has some level of consciousness. You haven't even defined it! Consciousness is probably not even an on/off but a spectrum. How do you define consciousness? A computer can tell you what processes are running what condition it's in, etc. Does that meet you definition?

You can't prove a negative. This is not how science works. Until you see something that violates known laws, you should assume that it functions according to known laws. And there have been countless experiments that show we can manipulate brain function and consciousness through chemicals, electrical, and magnetic stimulation. It's quite clear that humans operate according to physical laws. To assert otherwise is frankly certified nonsense."

And there you go again talking about magic, while I never claimed my position was backed up by magic. Thank you for demolishing that strawman.

>No it's not. You don't know anything about whether a machine has some level of consciousness.

I've seen zero reason to indicate any of the machines we have created so far possess consciousness. If you want to prove me wrong, then go ahead! Show me a conscious robot! Or are you just trying to be a contrarian?

>Consciousness is probably not even an on/off but a spectrum

There you go again with your baseless assertions. You think consciousness is a spectrum? Then prove it! 

>How do you define consciousness?

Different people use different definitions. As far as I'm concerned, if a machine doesn't have a subjective experience, then it's not conscious.

>A computer can tell you what processes are running what condition it's in, etc. Does that meet you definition?

No. A thermometer can tell me the room temperature, doesn't mean it's conscious.

>You can't prove a negative

Your statement is a negative. If your statement was true, then you would have proven a negative. Any claim can be framed like a negative.

>Until you see something that violates known laws, you should assume that it functions according to known laws

Conscious subjective experience is different from the objective impersonal analysis of physics. Physicalism doesn't account for consciousness. 

>And there have been countless experiments that show we can manipulate brain function and consciousness through chemicals, electrical, and magnetic stimulation.

We know there is a connection between brain and mind. All the informations our minds receive about the world come through the brain. Nothing new here.

>It's quite clear that humans operate according to physical laws. To assert otherwise is frankly certified nonsense.

Humans operate according to physical laws, but not to the extent you think they do. Not everyone is a reductionist. I think you should check out the problem of consciousness if you haven't already. It's an interesting topic to read about and learn about the different perspectives."

Lemme give you an example.

Renaissance artists and back then use to make their own paints and brushes. Each art master had their own studio and their own work force. Yes, there are many jobs lost due to modern industrial Era. It has brought about advancement and made paints and brushes cheap. But that doesn't mean that traditional artists are not true artists. 

You know what renassiace masters, traditional artists, digital artists, scribes, writers, type writers, and email writers have in common that one who gives prompts on chat gpt and ai ""artists"" don't have? Creativity.

All of the artists from Renaissance masters to digital artists go through pain staking process of developing their own artstyle. Countless research on basically every thing you want to draw, anatomy, compostion, color theory, figure drawing, perspectives, expressions, animals, still life drawing, I can go on and on. Sure making of stuff required for things and tools they need is gone, but the pain staking knowledge you need to cultivate your own signature artstyle and make art in such a creative way that each and every decision you make results in convey of the meaning, is not gone.

Ai art doesn't do that. Just like how poets and writers convey fresh and unique ideas with their words and their own writing styles, chat gpt doesn't.

This is the main reason that why artists so passionately hate ai art and what it stands for. It is basically spitting on creativity, hardwork and life long study and dedication.

And to top it all off, it basically steals stuff from other art. You may say inspiration, but no. It just is taking the average of all the art and giving you a result of most average art from the prompts you gave."

Besides, there are examples of AI art creation videos online and the well established AI artists never just type something in and get their final image. They iterate images, take them into photoshop and tweak them, iterate them again, combine them with others, tweak those, run them through, change bits using inpainting or outpainting. It can take a good AI artist hours to get the exact image they're looking for.

Sure, anyone can create a great image using AI with no experience. Just like anyone can get a great photo with no experience. But that doesn't mean there's no talent or skill in photography. The same is true of AI.

AI Artist doesn't realize who he's talking to,Sonic_the_hedgedog,https://i.redd.it/43dddqmxdxtb1.jpg,meeplewirp,"Art can be made using an LLM. Think about how an artist can train an LLM on their own work and utilize it to make a “bigger” (literally and metaphorically) piece in less time. 

Most of the time, utilizing an LLM to generate images or video amounts to discovery, not creation. It’s an amalgam of tons and tons of art humanity has created over time. I think it’s moral to appreciate the product of an open source LLM but not moral to make money off of it. 

To utilize an LLM to get a specific image, one that is indicative of the exact vision inside your head, is actually hilariously complex and involves way more than just the prompt. When you use it this way, it becomes a tool.  *This is the way that fine artists and actual craftsman will use the LLMs*. 

I think copyright will prevent people from making money off of LLMs that are basically a product of scraping the internet in its entirety without a contract. However, artists who work within the economy/as part of a job are going to have to recon with the fact that there are moral ways to utilize LLMs that will push many out of the process. There is going to be no copyright issue with writing contracts for the ability to use an artist’s LLM for a specific time. So they can hire 4 or 5 people instead of 50. We can cry and moan all we want, within the decade a lot of things in the entertainment world aren’t going to call for 50 to 100 people anymore."

A highly skilled painter can suck at the expression. An unskilled painter can still be great at art. 

An AI artist can suck, or be great at Art. The AI artist might be less skilled at the craft of painting, but still skilled at the AI art. 

Ive been an illustrator for about 39 years. I still do it now, but less then I used to. (I did everything from product illustration to Disney). Today I’ll use small AI elements in larger compositions, because it’s quicker and more specific then using stock art.

I suspect this will be workflow of almost all digital artists going forward. The amount of ""speed-up"" you get from AI is just mind boggling, so at this point you are actively handicaping yourself by not using it.

You can get good, but very specific results with something like the 4090 and a lot of training, but the vast majority of these ""AI artists"" are not building their own models, just writing prompts and maybe inpainting for slightly less lazy.

Where AI shines is using it as a way to generate ideas and concepts and variations, and then using and adapting those pieces to create a final work of art. 

Like, imagine trying to use an AI to illustrate a graphic novel. You'd get one frame that looks great, but what if you want the exact same character, but rotated slightly, or in a slightly different pose? The chances of getting the AI to reliably generate the same character but posed differently is exceptionally unlikely 

But, if you use the AI to help you generate the initial character and then use your own artistic skill to take that character and bring it to life, then you're using the tool for what it's good for, and using your skill as well."

Besides, there are examples of AI art creation videos online and the well established AI artists never just type something in and get their final image. They iterate images, take them into photoshop and tweak them, iterate them again, combine them with others, tweak those, run them through, change bits using inpainting or outpainting. It can take a good AI artist hours to get the exact image they're looking for.
 
Sure, anyone can create a great image using AI with no experience. Just like anyone can get a great photo with no experience. But that doesn't mean there's no talent or skill in photography. The same is true of AI.

AI is good for wading through the burdenous wastes of trying to make art happen under capitalism. Ethically, I don't think you can yet present anything it makes as final work. One day when nobody needs to make money to live, art will be freed from such pettiness as copyright, but until then we must be ethical about this.

EDIT: All my projects are super small budget (if any budget) and any AI images are generated and judged with the help of artist friends that I pay well out of my own pocket. Those same artists work on the final project, the AI just helps us explore and agree on different design choices.

Sure, that's a low bar, but it is higher than what the guy playing chess using an engine is doing.

Photos are faster but you're still creating something from scratch, all the aesthetic qualities that go into the picture are your own.   If you lack talent it's extremely hard to be a really good photographer.  I've been shooting for 10 years and still wouldn't consider myself a true professional. 

With AI you can make a master level picture with 0 practice or knowledge of what makes something good.  Sure you can select the main elements of an image but you're not what's actually making the image look amazing, it's the computer.  There are so many tiny tiny elements of a piece of art that bring together a final picture and can make or break something as good or meh.

I think some AI people do put more of themselves in it than others.  If you're really spending a lot of time fine tuning a final image, adjusting certain parts, editing it in post, etc there is a little bit more there.

AI Artist doesn't realize who he's talking to,Sonic_the_hedgedog,https://i.redd.it/43dddqmxdxtb1.jpg,lelieldirac,"Painting is the manifestation of perception and inner mind. Photography captures a still frame of the world from an individual's perspective.

AI images are the result of an algorithm that has processed billions of images (actual art and photography), trained to recognize and reconstruct graphical representations from noise, and then remix those graphical representations according to what it recognizes, how certain things are ""supposed"" to fit together, and noise.

Whereas a painter or photographer is limited only by their surroundings or imagination, AI is inherently limited by images that were created by humans. The use of these tools to ""create"" new images is inherently antithetical to human creation. This is especially apparent from the fact that whereas a great painter or photographer will invariably have a deep understanding of their tools and techniques, no ""AI artist"" will ever be considered great based on their understanding of AI models.

In fact, I would go so far as to say there will never be a great ""AI artist."" No prompt generator will ever be held to the likes of Van Gogh, Monet, Rembrandt, or Picasso. Those artists were never limited by a tool that is inherently unable to understand and interpret the world, and doesn't need to be understood to be used."

Art takes consideration, remixing, creating and above all else, thought. ""AI"" does not think. It is not ""Artificial Intelligence"" no matter how much people incorrectly use that term. ""AI"" still does not actually exist. It's algorithms that operate purely on a fixed input-output calculation. There is no thought, there is no intent, just averages smearing things together to meet an extremely complex mathematical collage.

That line of argument is ultimately worthless. Anyone creating something themselves is adding something that didn't exist before. Be it a way their choices and media elements are executed or how it is viewed through a cultural lens. Mathematics cannot do that. It cannot produce any new choices it can only take a pure average of everything that is input. There could be an argument for a cultural input from how the taggers choose to label the input image database, but that is ultimately more of an artefact than anything artistic done by the prompt jockey."

No. It doesn't. All those works need the level of creativity and deep sense of understandinf of the human nature, that only way a human can make a comparative structure for as metaphors or allegorical in nature. All the above fiction shaped and became a part of our culture. They all had an impact on us. 

So, imagine a world where demand of human written stories are gone, as all flock to ai for generating novels and novel concepts within seconds So that people can read abd consume this cheap stuff, adicted to it like drug because it can be easy to mass produce stories who's inly purpose is to hook the reader and give tmwhat people expect. Would that world be the same as our own? Woundn't our culture be filled with cheap generations of works without human touch?

It's the same with ai art. Not now, and not on an individual scale would it be harmful. But in the longterm across our culture it will if this technology is left just how it is now, it will become like a serpent eating itself with only few artists who make art in the world they are not respected."

The use of these tools to ""create"" new images is inherently antithetical to human creation.

Imagination isn't magic. People are incapable of creating something that they've never seen before - all human art is, in some ways, contingent on things the artist has seen in the world, be it nature or other peoples' art. A blind-at-birth person will never be able to conceptualize of anything visual, they need input from the outside world. An artist can see millions of colors in their life, they may learn to mix and combine them in masterful ways but their brain will never be able to imagine a color that's outside the range of their sight.

All that is to say, I don't see how generative AI with a world's worth of data is more ""constrained"" than the average person, when the person's ideas are inherently based on information they've learned before.

AI uses other works to create its own. It’s no different from an artist looking at a picture of Batman for inspiration on drawing his own superhero. 

If you don’t think that AI in its current Iteration is doing more than an average of the input you’re mistaken and don’t understand how it works. There is a layer of randomness which is interpreted as a choice. It may not be a choice you like, it may not be a sentient being making that choice, but it’s no different than a choice.

People have been whining that EDM ""isn't real music"" and ""they just press play"" since it's inception. For the shittier artists, this is absolutely true, but top tier artists can create something truly unique and spectacular. 

Just like electronic music, anyone can make a basic piece with the right tools and some time, but knowing the software in and out allows for the creation of intricacy and depth that is inaccessible to your average person. It's easy to say anyone could generate that AI art, but chances are 99% of the people saying that could not create something even relatively as good just by sitting down for a day and slamming prompts.

My favorite electronic musicians blend traditional instruments with samples and computer generated sounds. It is entirely feasible that we will see artists do the same. Sketch a rough drawing and feed it into an AI and then lay over their favorite generative phrases or whatever.

It's easy to say that anyone could do it, but most people can't and don't. If you look at sites where people share AI art, much of it is absolute garbage. While the AI may do much of the heavy lifting, it is clear that there is SOME skill involved in crafting the inputs or that disparity wouldn't exist. We're in the 90s techno phase of AI art, where 99% generated are turds, but I suspect we will be surprised at what is to come. I'm curious if we will see AI specific genres as well that just don't work as well with a human in control. Who could have predicted Dubstep before the technology was there?

I’ve played with Midjourney and prompted some cool images, and I would never call them “my art.” They’re collaborative works between the prompter, the people who wrote the AI code, and the artists whose work was used in the training dataset. 

I understand that the prompter can go in with a specific vision and be very exacting in their prompts, but they don’t have creative control in the way that you would in other artforms, including film and electronic music, which are commonly brought up in AI discourse. With a camera, you have direct control over which specific image you film/photograph, and with electronic music, you choose and sequence/arrange/record the samples or synths in your track. 

You could argue that generating AI images might be similar to what a film director does, where they rely on actors, film crew, set designers, editors, etc. as independent inputs in their creative vision. The difference for me is that the AI that produces the image can’t share in the vision – it has no intention. But either way, the film director generally isn’t and shouldn’t be credited as the sole artist behind a film, provided they didn’t actually do all the work themselves. 

Or, another analogy: you could compare it to a DJ set, where the DJ chooses the tracklist and might blend track-to-track in interesting ways, or augment it with record scratches or audio effects: that specific arrangement belongs to the DJ, but it’s recognized that DJing isn’t the same thing as producing music."

AI Artist doesn't realize who he's talking to,Sonic_the_hedgedog,https://i.redd.it/43dddqmxdxtb1.jpg,lelieldirac,"Human perception is transformative. No two people will perceive the same thing in the same way. In the 50's, Disney produced a documentary called ""4 Artists Paint 1 Tree"" which demonstrates this.

Therefore, your notion that ""people are incapable of creating something that they've never seen before"" could not be more incorrect. Any person's artistic representation of what they have seen or imagined has never been seen before. If you stood in the exact same spot where Monet stood when he painted plein air, or looked at a picture taken from the exact same perspective, or even looked at a painting by someone else that was done plein air at the same location -- would any of these be the same as viewing Monet's work?

AI does not perceive. It develops the capability to replicate existing photographs and artworks with perfect precision, pairs that data with language, and adds it to a soup of ""a world's worth of data"" as you put it. But the recombinant product of that data is not generated through perception, nor can a person use it to truly manifest their perception.

>What about people who make a sketch and put it through an AI model? Or people who model a rudimentary 3D scene and do the same? Or people who make their own art and use an AI-generated background on it? There's a ton of technologies and AI use can be done in degrees of most to least involvement - at what degree does a person's art suddenly turn into non-art?

This is quite philosophical and I'm not sure if I have a great answer yet. As a baseline, I would say that any image created from a text prompt is not art. The text itself could be art, be it a poem or lyric -- but if the words are not part of the output, then the output is data, not art. To take your example of a sketch: if someone created a sketch which was then cleaned up and painted by a team of artists, then the sketch artist could not take full credit for the finished piece. The same would be true if the artist put their sketch through an AI model. The end result is not exactly ""non-art,"" but it is transformed in a way that is difficult to separate human input and data."

You try to compare using AI to generate an image to a photographer, but the comparison just doesn't work. The photographer needs both intent and *skill* to capture a beautiful image. Further, they must exert effort to be in positions where artistic pictures can be taken, and have the knowledge of what tools to use to get the quality of image they want.

Someone with their dick in one hand, and a keyboard on the other, can for-loop their way to a good looking image. They don't need to have any knowledge of the tool they are using, they don't have to manipulate anything, and they don't need any skill. Just enough knowledge to write a for-loop, the most basic of programming, and at least one working eyeball.

With AI, it's the computer making those decisions, there's not a lot of connection between the person making the image and the final output.  

Very simple but think of it this way: if you typed in 'painting of a women on a beach' and the AI generates this beautiful image, what exactly did you bring to it's creation?  You literally just chose the most basic subject matter, which isn't really that creative of a choice.  Describing what's in a good image doesn't necessarily make you an artist. 

Color, composition, expression, lighting, contrast, focal point, etc etc etc etc, are all elements of what artists need to think about when they create something.  It's the reason you can have two portraits that have drastically different styles or one is amazing and one looks like armature garbage.  The AI is just pulling from other 'good' stuff and generalizing it into your image, you're not doing anything.

An AI requires some prompts and does 99% of the work, largely by using already existing works, that always end up uncredited.

Making a mod menu that vastly changes the function of the original work is art, but using it isn't as much.

To me, if you're going to disparage AI art, it needs to be from a different angle than some variation of ""its not how it was done before"" or else it just comes off in the same vein as an 1800s portrait artist clutching his pearls at modern-day camera photographers (""wheres the skill in taking a photo versus mastering oil paints!!""). Frankly, photoshop (thus far) has been a far bigger and more influential jump in technology but no one accosts professional artists who exclusively use photoshop.

The valid criticisms of AI are that it needs to be regulated in a sense of ownership/copyright.

Any person's artistic representation of what they have seen or imagined has never been seen before. If you stood in the exact same spot where Monet stood when he painted plein air, or looked at a picture taken from the exact same perspective, or even looked at a painting by someone else that was done plein air at the same location -- would any of these be the same as viewing Monet's work?

I fail to see how this contradicts my point, I feel like you might be misunderstanding its foundation. I'm not saying that every person is exposed to the same information and fundamentally forms the same perception of art. What I am saying, however, is that the essence of human creativity is combination of previously existing knowledge. But every person has their own set of information - what they saw in real life, the art they observed and were taught about, the things that they trained on differ vastly from person to person. The reason why that hypothetical person wouldn't see the same things Monet saw is because the ""data"" they'd accumulated throughout life would give them a different outlook on a scene from Monet, not because there's some unseen force that's influencing their artistic outputs.

The point of all this is that, while I'm not looking to anthropomorphize generative AI, the ways in which they operate aren't *that* far mechanically removed from how humans combine knowledge. Image generators can combine ideas that were never seen in their datasets - for example, I've never seen a blue dog, but I can imagine what one looks like. An image generator would also have no trouble with picturing a blue dog, as its training allow it to picture what a ""dog-ful"" and a ""blue"" image look like, and how these concepts interact.

> As a baseline, I would say that any image created from a text prompt is not art.

Why not? What an AI does is take in the input string (alongside with other data), does some processing, and returns an output of that information, which just happens to be image data. Is it about the algorithmic involvement? If that is the case, wouldn't I lose all credit when, for example, applying a gaussian blur filter in Photoshop? After all, I have no idea on how it works and all the input data that's given to it is irreversibly altered by the program.

> The text itself could be art, be it a poem or lyric - but if the words are not part of the output, then the output is data, not art.

How is something being data at odds with something being art? Almost anything in the world can be redefined as data, and even if you constrained yourself to the realm of computers, that'd invalidate all digitally-produced media ever made. And if the reference point is something being human-made, that also invalidates almost everything - a musician who passes their work through an automated noise reduction algorithm probably has no idea on how it works. So is a video editor altering the color gamut or compositing a video frame. The degree of computer involvement is already pretty immense before we start talking about AI.

> if someone created a sketch which was then cleaned up and painted by a team of artists, then the sketch artist could not take full credit for the finished piece. The same would be true if the artist put their sketch through an AI model.

This would be completely true if the AI algorithm had its own agency and decision-making process. Yet, everything that it does is a result of human input (and some randomness) - the output imagery is derived precisely from what the human set it up to do, be it the input text, their sketch that they loaded in, how every setting is configured to process said sketch, and so on. It's a deterministic process, so it's inaccurate to portray it as the author just throwing their sketch out to some other artists and hoping that something good comes out - the work of the author is integral to what's being made."

You can use AI generators as part of a greater work or process. It's just another tool in the tool box, and one that artists would be foolish to ignore. As a point of fact, they don't. AI generation is a feature of Adobe Photoshop now, for example.

Also, AI generators don't store ""stolen"" pixels. It's a bit of a simplification, but through training, the models build functions. It's not that there's a million different pictures of a frog in an AI generator, and the generator picks one or two when you prompt it with ""frog"".

Instead, there's some generalized functions that have learned how to draw frogs. That's why a prompt like ""frog wearing a party hat"" works. It combines the functions for drawing a frog with the functions for drawing a party hat.

In a typical GAN, the generator doesn't even look at the training data! Not ever. The ""stolen"" art is viewed by the generator precisely never.  Instead, the generator is told to draw a frog. It tries. The results are essentially random.

Then a discriminator model decides if the generator did a good job or not. Mixed in with the results from the generator are real images of frogs and drawn images of frogs. Slowly, the discriminator learns how to tell AI frogs from real frogs, and the generator learns how to trick the discriminator into ""thinking"" that its generated pixels are real pictures of frogs."

Again, same as people whining about the 'just press play' DJ. What happened to those DJs? They don't exist outside of tiny ass clubs. Same will happen for AI art, but the question is what major players will look like.

What about when AI training becomes less costly and time consuming? What if artists are able to feed their own art into an AI generator. Or they feed their own art of landscapes, plus actual photos of landscapes (yes, I get it that photos are art and its more complicated but lets not chase semantics for a second. Say they have the rights to these photos).

Maybe artists will collaborate. Two artists create AIs trained on their own art, and trade the AIs to see how they blend when they feed their art into each others style. Electronic music is the same.

I would say that your sound library comparison isn't perfect. Sampling is a massive part of many modern genres, and it fits more closely with what you say isn't ok, but we have found legal and respectful ways to handle it. We'll find solutions. An AI that is only available to the public after being trained on over 10,000 artists, and each has to volunteer to be apart of it. Would the variation be enough to kill the straight up stealing of style? I don't know, but to say that we are stuck in a derivative situation is to bow down to the current iteration of AI without looking for solutions.

It shocks me that so many people here think they can call this case closed, when I can pick a bunch of examples just from the 90s alone that show how so many things aren't art until suddenly they are. 

Rap wasn't art. Graffiti wasn't art. Electronic music wasn't art. Digital illustration wasn't art. The percentage of people who think these things are art now is exponentially higher. This means the definition of art is not static, or even consistent among people in the same time, place, and culture.

I wonder how many of these people would do complete 180s if they saw a video on a paralyzed person creating AI art to generate the vivid images they have in their head but can't create, but can attempt to describe.

I've made this comparison in a bunch of other responses, but something someone said made me think of an orchestra. Is a conductor an artist? He is simply giving commands to a human hive mind machine. Are the people in the orchestra artists? They are playing music they didn't create, based on the directions of the conductor. Is orchestra music art? Are the people who play it artists? Is only the person who wrote the original music an artist? People are tearing apart AI art using these ways of framing things, but orchestra music also falls apart under the same scrutiny and I question if anyone would say that an orchestra is not art.

If we can't even come up with a good common definition of art, then how are people so comfortable making these black and white boxes for art to live in? Do any of those points even matter, or are they just distracting from the nuance of discussing a subject that, in the end, is more about how it makes people feel than any real dictionary definition."
AI Artist doesn't realize who he's talking to,Sonic_the_hedgedog,https://i.redd.it/43dddqmxdxtb1.jpg,TheMilitantMongoose,"Why? There is no perfect comparison, because art is not a simple idea. That is one of the key points I am making. My comparison starts with how people perceive and talk about it. The way AI art is, and 90s electronic music was, discussed is nearly identical. The number of people who would consider electronic music to be art in the 90s would be a tiny percentage of people who consider it art now. This means the definition of art changes over time, which is also important.

Are musicians artists if they are replaying music they made in the past? What about if they are just following sheet music? Would that not make them more similar to the AI interpreting instructions than an artist generating something new? Are the conductors of an orchestra artists? They are just giving instructions to a human machine. What makes an orchestra different from an AI then? It receives instructions and translates it as best as it can. If being able to do this repeatedly means that AI art is not art, then orchestras are not art. Or can we find more granular differences that split that comparison? None of these are simple discussions, and that means anyone who has decided they can call this case closed is doing so out of forceful ignorance and an unwillingness to discuss nuance. It's complicated, and that is what I find interesting."

Yes, they're directly involved in a hell of a lot of centrally important creative decisions. When I prompt midjourney ""pretty girl diving into a pool"", midjourney makes almost ALL the creative decisions. What colour hair and skin does the girl have? What's her posture and position? Is she mid dive or just about to jump? Is the camera in front of her or behind her? What swim suit is she wearing? Are there trees? What type of tree? Is the pool by a house? What does the house look like? What colour scheme is there?

All of these questions midjourney creatively answers with no input from the prompter. Midjourney is doing the same kind of creative decision making that a human artist would be doing if you asked a human artist to do the same prompt. If you wouldn't call the prompter ""the artist"" when it's just a prompt handed to a human artist, then why would you when the prompt is handed to midjourney?

Again, you can for-loop your way into a pleasant image.

The head committe who came up with making a new special (let's say maple syrup themed cookie recipe) are not chefs. They gave a prompt to the OG chef. The OG chef makes the recipe for them. That's his ""commision"". Here, he is using his skills he developed by himself on his own to make this recipe. 

You can't compare him to a ai art generator would you? In the same vein, ""ai artists"" are not giving their creativity just like how the higher ups in applebees came up with the idea of recipe. 

Another example would be how the people would commission art from artists. They give some set of rules, sometimes a rough sketch,  sometimes along with what colours they want the artist to use, etc. The artist draws it to them (here is the main key word) with their own CREATIVE interpretation.

Now comparing this to the people who give prompts to ai. They are commissioning art. And ai art is (the difference) not at all using ots own creativity to interpret from what the prompt maker had given.

Just like how commisioners and patrons of art are not artists, in the similar vein, the people who give prompts aren't artists.

Just like how you as a person learn from everything you see in the world, and yes that includes all the other art you consume. The ai also learns from everything in it's original training database. The inference model, linking a web of concepts is quite like a brain's own web of ideas and concepts. 

The resulting mix in a human is what you call creativity and individuality, it's the same with the ai. 

What the ai lacks, is agency. The drive to actually use this inference model to create something, which is where a human comes in and tells it WHAT, to do with this inference model.  

The end result is the ai's creative matrix, and the human's agency dictating what exactly it is being used to create.  

And bam, we now have art.   

As for the comparison to someone tracing art, I would liken is more to someone who's seen for example a lot of simpsons episodes, and now is able to draw very good reproductions of simpsons characters. Sure it's his own character in that style but he's seen enough episodes to know how to reproduce it holding to their style guide.

And yes, effectively, the work is then used to generate things via those functions.  It does not matter in the least how it ultimately works when its been taught with things it wasn't supposed to be taught with.

There is absolutely nothing okay with that, at all, even if the derivative functions learned by amalgamation of all these works isn't an exact replication of someone's work, its still built on work that had no permission given to be used.  And when you can prompt an AI to replicate someone's style, its absolutely a massive problem that infringes on someone's work unfairly.

Let alone someone else's hours of work refining their skill and style is used without permission to let someone else effectively generate something for no effort or much time at all.  I say this as someone who has done art.  (Not amazing art, but art is art.)  I've spent some time, paid my dues.  I would rather create from my own hands and my own vision as AI will never be able to absolutely perfectly capture that which I envision as it is, let alone using other people's efforts to make the functions.

No matter how you break it down, somewhere, someone's work was used without permission to make things happen.  That's always been the biggest stickler.

And I've seen people steal someone's WIP and try to spit out the final work via AI by feeding the WIP and trying to have it finished and claim the work (in whole) as their own.  Thankfully people caught on quick and called the BS out, but don't tell me people won't steal others works and use them wrongly, on top of the already used as references without permission part.

(Yes yes don't blame the tool blame the person, but the tool shouldn't be allowed to use people's works like that IMO.  Also artists shouldn't have a reason to NEED to use AI to do something if they're good enough, they've been doing all the work as is for a LONG ass time without.)"

I think you'll find this sentiment isn't shared by the majority of professional artists. It's output is too low quality and unreliable to do anything, it's much more effective to just gather a small library of references than to build off of anything AI gives you.

And in fact, I've seen many argue against the idea that upcoming artists should rely on it either. Being an ""artist of the gaps"" that simply reworks or touches up AI art will lead to some very sloppy work and robs them of the opportunity to truly understand any of the fundamentals at play.

Pretty sure most trained artists (not the fake Discord artists in this thread though) wouldn't either, considering that's literally the whole point of art school. Painting an abstract piece is not inherently derivative because someone did abstract before.

Where on time & effort curve do cooking, art, and creativity happen? I think that's a more fundamental issue which ppl need to agree on first. I'm not going to claim 5 min cup of noodles is cooking but I certainly think adding in a handful of fresh ingredients and a few pot swirls is. AI's currently at the same weird spot imo Subways is.

I think this is a bit of the crux of it. When you make something in Stable Diffusion, you don't just generate an image and that's it. You generate multiple images, you tweak the prompt, you adjust the settings, and so on. You would then often want to open it in an image editor to do some adjustments. Maybe combine several of the images into one. 

Compare that to *""If art commissioners aren't artists, then why would AI generator users be?""* - if someone had a description then commissioned say ... 40 drawings, then looked through them, gave new description and commissioned 30 more drawings, adjusted description, then 50 more drawings, then from all of those picked out a few good, and did some adjustments to them.

Not really. That is also a skill artists learn to use. It involves aspects of creative writing, which is also art. They may also create artworks to act as early drafts for the AI to work off. Or they could combine two different pieces in order to get the image they want. Or they could take an AI piece and change it in photoshop to make it fit their vision. 

You're really just describing obstacles facing someone who has never used AI art and wants to create something. 

It's also worth noting most of the AI artists I've seen were previously traditional or digital artists, who either partially integrated AI into their work or shifted over completely. There are digital artists who use inpainting to tweak certain parts of their works, or use their work as an image prompt to slightly change its vibe or atmosphere or add details. It's commonly used by photographers to remove unappealing parts from photos. And image restorers love it because it can be a more effective tool than photoshop. So clearly their artistic creativity, eye, and vision was helpful there.

Here is an example of artists using AI to complement their work, as a tool.

It really seems like you're being judgemental about something you only have a surface knowledge of. It's fine if you don't think it's art (people have always disagreed on what counts as art), but it's rude to go telling others whether they're legitimate artists or whether their work is real art."

You know what renassiace masters, traditional artists, digital artists, scribes, writers, type writers, and email writers have in common that one who gives prompts on chat gpt and ai ""artists"" don't have? Creativity.

All of the artists from Renaissance masters to digital artists go through pain staking process of developing their own artstyle.

Sure making of stuff required for things and tools they need is gone, but the pain staking knowledge you need to cultivate your own signature artstyle and make art in such a creative way that each and every decision you make results in convey of the meaning, is not gone.

Ai art doesn't do that. Just like how poets and writers convey fresh and unique ideas with their words and their own writing styles, chat gpt doesn't.

Your worry is that it's a machine intelligence doing the learning instead of a biological brain. *That is your own hang-up.* It's an antiquated idea that's set to become even more antiquated as models get smarter.

By some reports, GPT-4V didn't train on images. It mostly trained on *descriptions* of images. (This isn't 100% known fact. OpenAI isn't very open about their training methodologies.)

Yet if you feed it an image, it can tell you what that image depicts. It's not that crazy of a step for a multi-modal transformer model to output images someday. GPT-5 might not just perceive visual imagery, but be able to output it as well *without necessarily training on visual images.*

Based just on descriptions.  Are you going to ban software from looking at descriptions now? Ban them from perceiving the world and coming up with their own art styles?

The world is shifting. Your ideas for how things are supposed to work are obsolete. *There's nothing you can do about that except adapt.* If you ban training models in the US and Europe, they'll get trained in Japan and China instead.

To me, using AI image generators is basically the same as using an image search engine but the images are created by the engine as you're searching instead of already existing. 

Would you call yourself an artist for using Google image or Pinterest to search something up? You can describe the act of searching up an image in the same exact way.

Something new is created based on the input of a human. Something that didn't exist before, that now exists. I don't think that can compare with using a search engine to find existing images.

Technically, when an image model is trained it learns certain text connects to certain patterns. Note that this doesn't mean for example a specific image of a tree, but the general pattern of trees. It also learns composition of those different patterns. When you write a prompt, that ""activates""or promotes different patterns that will be used to generate the image. When it generates the image it starts with white noise, and then iteratively look for similarities to the patterns the prompt promoted. For what's not in the prompt it will fill in with patterns usually seen in those connections. My point is, what's being generated is directly linked to the input prompt, which can be very generic or very detailed. And something new and unique is created from that prompt.

The same way a security camera's footage is not automatically a ""movie"". It's just footage taken in a space for security purposes. AI ""art"" is not art unless it has a person adjusting and reconfiguring it during or after the fact.

I feel like the portrayal in the first paragraph is kind of at odds with generative AI. While I agree that, broadly, AI outputs that have more work done on them have a higher chance of having an artistic message being put in them by the author, I disagree that this is such a clear line. As I said in a different comment, AI outputs are almost entirely deterministic, and contingent on the input given to them by the person. Anyone who uses a generative AI has infinitely more control over the resulting imagery than a security guard setting up a CCTV recording. Not to mention, why ""during or after""? I feel like most people would agree that, if I were to model a basic 3D scene on my own and feed it into a generative AI as depth data, it'd make my involvement in the work a lot higher, even though it happens before the generation.

> But the current narrative is to replace artists, not supplement them. ""Look, you can make a game without knowing how to draw or hiring anyone who can!!"" That's the moral issue.

Is it though? I feel like, outside of a few very bitter people, that perception is ascribed by those artists. The *vast* majority of people using AI aren't replacing anyone directly, but enhancing their capabilities with what they couldn't do before. Few businesses are using generative AIs for images, but tons of people make throwaway tokens for their tabletop RPG sessions. Is the latter one replacing an artist? I guess, in the same way as going on a trip and taking pictures on your phone replaces the photographer that you could've hired. But most people wouldn't have considered that in the first place.

Ultimately, artists will be the ones who will need to adapt to the new tech, but I suspect that it won't be replacing them any more than photography replaced artists who draw in a photorealistic style."

If you think tracing is a masterful act of art, I envy how easy you are to please.    
I think you may be confusing ""art"", the category, with ""art"", the concept. Yes, people colloquially use ""art"" to describe anything involving creation--music, drawing, etc--but we're (or at least I am) speaking about art as an accomplishment. Simply creating a painting--or a jpeg, in this case--doesn't accomplish an artistic gesture. Sure, computers are masters of styles by dint of simply copying pixels, but there is no artistic merit behind their actions. That is, they have no idea beyond ""copy this"" to back up their masterful arrangement of color. Nothing an AI (currently) creates will ever be hung in a museum except as an example of *human* accomplishment: they'll be displayed for the human creating the AI, not the AI creating the images.

Again, this could change in the future, and you can definitely come up with artistic uses for AI images. But simply plugging a prompt into an AI is not art, regardless of how many iterations of an image you create.

\*Edit: I remembered there is a hilarious example that runs counter to my argument: the original *Mona Lisa* is never displayed in the Louvre.

>I make a lot of money, because I figured out what, in art, makes money. And that’s  invoking emotion. Make the viewer/reader/listener feel somthing.

The first problem with what you said is that most things do invoke an emotion. That is just an objective fact.

If you mean something that touches you, and stands up....LOL. Please, the most popular stuff out there are stuff like the MCU, or modern mainstream pop and hip-hop, which are mostly generic, and empty, but safe and innofensive.

Also, you ignore an important fact. The fact piracy objectively hurts artists, as proven by actual studies. And the fact that the business owners do not respect your work, and will do everything to take away as much of the money you make as possible.

>Stop using the term “elitist”, it’s not working. To me it’s a compliment, as it’s only used by unsuccessfully people describing successful people.

You type of thinking is authoritarian, hierarchal, quasy-feudalist, and just down right pathetic.

Being succesful means nothing. Idiots like the Elongated Muskrat are succesful. Being succesful means nothing in our society. Success has nothing to do with actual skills, or with morality. it has more to do with the accident of birth, with luck, with the way the algorithm works, with the labor laws in your country, with the state of social programs in your country, and with the level of corruption in your country.

Actual merit does not play a role.

>Your are an unemployed …somthing so irrelevant not even you thought it was important enough to list. So, clearly unsuccessful.

Because of the conditions around the country. My country is corrupt, the private sector is corrupt, the government does not want to hire people, and because I chose to be an individual and study something that I love(Biology), the jobs that are ideal for me, are rare.

>So you calling me elitist is a compliment to me.

So being an arrogant prick is a compliment to you? You are a pathetic person.

>I CLEARLY understand art better then you, because I’m very successful at it.

No. You are succesful because you make the generic and safe stuff the corporations want you to make, and because your content is algorithmically optimal(and thus emotionally empty).

That is why you are „succesful”(which I find a highly doubtful claim by the way).

>If you were good at art, your hobby would be your career, since you have no other.

> ""Eh I'm a photographer, and I don't think they're comparable.""'

Yes, that was the one. The refutation is exactly that, that it *is* actually a bit of work and input to get what you want out of an AI generator. Same as with photography. I mean, you can luck out and take a great photo by pure chance, same as with AI generators. But if you have something in mind and want an image with that, it's a lot more complicated for both. His argument against AI being similar was *""you just type in what you want and bam you got a master level picture""* - which is wrong.

> How about the ""That is an argument as old as time"" chain?

That's just more of the same argument. Saying it takes more effort and creative input to take photos than to make AI images. In both cases the effort can go from more or less zero to a lot of work. Setting up a scene in photography, the lighting, the reflectors, shadows, color composition, and then post processing.. It's a lot of work getting exactly what you want. But you can also just take semi random snapshots and get some fantastic images out of it. AI generators are the same.

> photography is still an art form that allows for creativity and expression by the artist [...]  it's in how they take the picture, and all the decisions that go into that.

But it's the same generating AI images. With photography you take what's in real world, and produce what you want from it. But you don't for example make the wall the model is leaning against, or the clothes she's wearing, or the vines, or the grass.. You see what's there, and then you build on that.

With AI you might start with a simple prompt, but then it's wrong angle, or missing what should be there, so you add more to the prompt. You might want a specific style on it, and you add more. You change generator settings to get closer to what you want, and you might find one prompt makes the background you want, but the main part is wrong, and another makes horrible backgrounds but the main focus part is exactly what you want.

For me, this is a lot like photography. I've been doing hobby photography for ~10 years, and been playing a bit on and off with stable diffusion the last year, and for me they are comparable. Both can be done with near zero creative input, and with a a lot of creative input."

Does not allowing ai art to be considered art contribute to the growth of art? Does allowing ai art to be called art take away from what you create as an artist? Artists are considering the value of their art over the growth ai art because it is what's important to them and affects them. 

Of course ai art doesn't compare to the creation process of art as we've defined it for thousands of years, but that only holds true for most people. If you used your own pieces to generate something using ai, would it not still be art and you an artist. If similarly someone made an imagine, refined it over hundreds of prompts to achieve the end product they wanted, finally presenting what they made, is that not an artistic process? They may have not physically made it, but they still made decisions on how they wanted their piece to be seen, how they interpreted their end product, and made adjustments as they redefined the image.

And that's where I draw the parallel to photography. You rarely have 100% control over the result. Clouds change,  lighting change, wind moves things, people move, and so on. If you move it into a studio you have more control, but then you need to have a studio, and studio lights and backdrop and so on. And you still don't have full control. 

But truth is, most of the small details doesn't really matter. When you take photos of a model outside for example, you don't care exactly how a wall or a tree looks, just that it's there and fits the aesthetic you're looking for. You don't need that level of control to get good photos. And same as with AI generation, you take *a lot of* photos to overcome that. I'm just a hobbyist, but a friend of mine that's a professional photographer can take over 3000 photos in one photoshoot, only to use maybe 10 or 20 of them. Exactly because there's not full control and you compensate by taking a shit ton of photos to find the good ones.

And another point, artists sometimes use assistants to paint in background stuff in paintings, simply because it's not quite that important. And in that vein, my friend have started experimenting with AI fill / inpainting to replace backgrounds for his photos.

Anyway, that is my view of it. I appreciate the response too, because I want to broaden my own mind on the topic and it's good to hear actual arguments and thoughts outside of ""Well, I don't like it"" or ""Because it's different!""

**Edit:** You might find this interesting, or perhaps not. It's not meant neither for or against AI generated images being art or artistic really, it's just something I found a bit neat. 

I wrote a script some time ago to test a prompt over a set of stable diffusion models that are trained on different images, mostly to see how different models ""interpret"" the prompt. It generates 6 batches of 6 images for each model, total of 36 images per model. [Here is an example with a very basic prompt](https://myws.h.thelazy.net/gen1/), *""Swordsman, on cliff, drawn art, stoic, looking out over forest, leather armor, grey hair, red bandana""*. Note that some model's output colors are muted / slightly off / show purple blotches. My script doesn't apply VAE to the models that need it, which makes the color ""rendering"" somewhat off. It's not important for my use though, as I don't plan to use the results directly. 

I think it's neat though, shows how much or how little the prompt affects the result, and how different models have clear different styles. It also shows how few images are directly usable. In almost all there's something weird with the sword or armor or hands or ... Something's almost always off."

With AI, the AI will not stop you or question your ideas. If you want something, you get that thing. It isn't going to tell you that you are putting too many ideas into the image, it isn't going to tell you the image doesn't work, or that your idea would be better if you we did it another way.

As someone who has worked in the game and animation industry for 18 years I don't think you really understand the scope of what you want to replace.

AI doesn't understand emotional story beats or tone. You will not only have to have the ai create the animation you will need it do layout, storyboards, cleanup, continuity, and lipsynch. Let's assume in your scenario the animation friends have access to cheap editing software. Every shot they prompt will need the correct layout, have a background that draws attention to the correct areas and had the right emotional tone. In a simple talking head shot this seems possible once ai gets to the point of actual consistency but rendering something that complicated takes time and will be very frustrating when a shot has to be rendered 100 times because the prompt was off. Your going to run into tangents, too much movement, not enough movement. There are so many things that can go wrong In a single shot. We have checkers for that reason. Your system only allows final product and if there is a small flaw your team still has to correct it.

Now they have to do it 1000 times to make a film. I don't think that the tech industry is going to put money into ai long enough for them to reach the level of consistency required to make a cohesive film. A single episode of a Television show can take a year to make with a full team creating props outfit changes and backgrounds. Creating just one coherent minute long scene could take weeks using prompts with no garuntee a prop will change color Midway.

But you probably don't mind those little inconsistencies because a little team made it. It makes me wonder tho Why do we need to settle for mediocre work because you want Ai to take precedence over handmade art. I don't think you grasp the scale of how big this Ai program would have to be and quite honestly you seem eager, even gleeful, to put artists out of work before you have a program that creates anything but a pale imitation of what humans can do. 

You walked into a field, told everyone they could leave because they were redundant then provided an infant  algorithm that will probably never receive enough funding to be viable as a replacement for trained experts. Don't you think that's a bit insufferable?"

Were you angry at artisan cloth weavers & master tailors when you bought your t-shirt off a rack?

To you this is personal, but to the rest of the world this is just one more spoke on the wheel of progress.

>Now they have to do it 1000 times to make a film. I don't think that the tech industry is going to put money into ai long enough for them to reach the level of consistency required to make a cohesive film

Oh you would be suprised, very very suprised then. The same argument was made about robotics and car assembly, the same argument was made about online shopping, the same argument was made about digital cameras, the same argument was even made about current AI art generators.

Being able to create content with 95% less staff is the holy grail of every tv studio, film house, games studio, youtube content creator - and so on and so forth.

>AI doesn't understand emotional story beats or tone. You will not only have to have the ai create the animation you will need it do layout, storyboards, cleanup, continuity, and lipsynch. Let's assume in your scenario the animation friends have access to cheap editing software. Every shot they prompt will need the correct layout, have a background that draws attention to the correct areas and had the right emotional tone. In a simple talking head shot this seems possible once ai gets to the point of actual consistency but rendering something that complicated takes time and will be very frustrating when a shot has to be rendered 100 times because the prompt was off. Your going to run into tangents, too much movement, not enough movement. There are so many things that can go wrong In a single shot. We have checkers for that reason. Your system only allows final product and if there is a small flaw your team still has to correct it.

And all of the above is exactly why artists will still be around, in the same way a large company will still have a few HR reps even though software has made the other 30 HR positions redundant.

AI doesn't remove humans completely, it allows them to work at 20 times the rate - curation, taste, judgement are still important.

>Creating just one coherent minute long scene could take weeks using prompts with no garuntee a prop will change color Midway.

Continuity is one problem that AI isn't going to have to deal with - because of the fundamental math going on under the hood. It would be like worrying that cake batter will suddenly turn into a shepards pie in the oven.

>You walked into a field, told everyone they could leave because they were redundant then provided an infant algorithm that will probably never receive enough funding to be viable as a replacement for trained experts.

I do the same thing with AI generators. I run prompts and blend images together to create cool looking messes. It's not any different from someone splattering paint on a canvas to make an abstract piece of art.

If i shut down every single coal power plant and build new advanced nuclear power plants, a large portion of people will lose their jobs because they cannot transfer their skills."

The job I’m describing is in no way like a court scribe, it was usually done in monasteries (in Europe). These people had nothing to do with courts, except the fact they sometimes sold stuff to them. I am talking about people who took, for example, the New Testament, and re-wrote it themselves often adding art and decorations, and no two books were the same aesthetically. Again, you clearly have no idea what I’m talking about and it’s quite sad at this point, that you keep making up things and passing them off as right to win a reddit argument. 
These people lost their jobs and never recovered, just because it is “ancient” doesn’t mean anything, in 500 years this argument about AI “art” and art is going to be ancient too."

Nuclear plants are just giant steam generators at their core, same as a coal plant.  A trained electrician would be able to work at literally ANY power generation facility, because power is power, wire is wire, and learning the new control system to be an actual plant technician would require minimal job retraining.

You picked one of the worst examples possible to make your point"

Plus this isn’t true, take a look at the article I’ll link at the bottom, it shows that while there is a high transference rate between green and non-green jobs (such as plant workers) it is not a full 100% transference rate, and thus people will lose their jobs.

Facial recognition in their case is pretty much exactly the same apart from in their case using 'neural' networks to make the calculations faster, I stick by my original comment, no AI really involved, unless you want to count the fast maths, they use other AI for sure, but the suggestion with this video is the glasses are using AI, the glasses take the image, his mate is nearby with a laptop and does the rest, uploading, sorting the results then returning the results, he is copying two students from Harvard who did it first."

It's 685 BILLION parameter large. At the speed the model is running over at [https://chat.deepseek.com/](https://chat.deepseek.com/) there is literally no way that they do not use a shitton of h100s. I also like underdog stories but this is not it. either:

A. nobody is actually using their models and because of that they have no problems with 1 dude pushing 50 prompts a day (you can multiple accounts even after that to get infinite r1), meaning 50 x at least 1 minute compute time for a single complex request the user makes, meaning 1 hour compute time for a single free user

or b: they actually have 50k h100s and can bear the load because of that.

There are no other options, A 685b model that takes on average a minute output thinking time is absolutely an atrocious compute strain. If even a 1% of openai users would use deepseek, their severs would collapse, even with 50k h100s."

Maliciously painting a negative narrative for the american public to distrust their own businesses even more is clearly a bad thing.

You basically bought the Chinese narrative and are fighting their own battle for them, exactly as they wanted. You complain about people being influenced easily , and here you are influenced and defending a clear Chinese government lie."

They, I think, have their own cluster, do not rent it, so, the cost is spread over many things that they use it for, and also, of course, the cost of training the final version of the model is not just the compute, not at all (although since GPT-4, I think, people began to call the final training compute ""rent"" cost as model's final training cost, despite some companies having their own clusters that cost them more/less over some time)."

I know I'm pissing in the wind here, but that's not actually Occam's (Ockham's) razor. Occam's razor is a tool for philosophers and scientists, which says that given two theories which have equal explanatory power but differ in complexity, you discard the more complex theory in favor of the simpler one. We're talking about philosophical principles and scientific theories here, not ""I think X happened.""

It has no applicability to individual events. It's irrelevant for determining whether a particular person broke a cookie jar, or whether Chinese researchers have H100s or how many.

For example in programming when you ask o1 for any method it tells you how you should call with a brief explanation. I noticed that the wording is the same in Deepseek when the model explain how to call the method. I need to do more testing, but the more you use it you can see the similarities.

Some/much of it has sunk into its training data, as well as many other model's (they all, at least in the near past, could once in a while say that they were made by OpenAI, especially if the author companies didn't force-train them to understand ""what they are"", and for some reasons, they do not, yet).  
To eradicate it, they either must automatically filter out everything with ""OpenAI"" or ""GPT 3.5/4/""whatever other model, OpenAI's or not, but risk losing some useful information too.  
Or... idk. Manually filtering data to check if the mention of GPT 3.5 makes sense in that context, to remain in the training datasets, is impossible, there is too much of it. Employing LLMs to semantically filter it, could be very expensive for now.

1. Family Background and Early Privilege
	•	Wang was born into a well-educated family in Los Alamos, New Mexico. His parents were physicists who worked on projects related to the U.S. military, which suggests he grew up in an environment emphasizing STEM and intellectual achievement.
	•	This background likely provided early exposure to high-level problem-solving and the confidence to pursue challenging fields like AI.

Alexandr Wang’s parents were physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, earning a combined income of approximately $314,400 per year. This places his family firmly in the top 5% of earners in New Mexico, where the 95th percentile income is around $200,000, and the median household income is just $62,125. Additionally, Los Alamos County, where he grew up, has the highest median household income in the U.S. at $150,000, making it one of the wealthiest and most resource-rich areas in the country. Contrast this with New Mexico’s poverty rate of 18.2% (one of the highest in the U.S.), and it’s clear Wang’s upbringing provided immense financial and educational advantages unavailable to most people in the state.

2. Access to Elite Education
	•	He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the most prestigious universities globally, known for producing top-tier entrepreneurs and innovators.
	•	Getting into MIT is often not just about intelligence but also about having access to resources like elite schooling, tutors, and extracurricular opportunities that signal excellence to admissions boards.

3. Silicon Valley Proximity
	•	Wang dropped out of MIT and moved to Silicon Valley, a hub for venture capital and tech innovation. This move alone reflects access to networks that are unavailable to the average entrepreneur.
	•	In Silicon Valley, proximity to venture capitalists, incubators, and influential mentors dramatically increases the likelihood of securing funding and scaling a business.

4. Venture Capital and Networks
	•	Scale AI raised significant funding early on from prominent venture capital firms, including Accel and Index Ventures. These firms typically invest in founders who are well-connected, highly credentialed, or introduced through trusted networks.
	•	Without these introductions and access to capital, it is unlikely that Scale AI would have grown as rapidly as it did.

5. Timing and Market Trends
	•	Wang launched Scale AI at a time when artificial intelligence and data labeling were booming industries, driven by demand from companies like Tesla and Waymo. His entry into this space coincided with massive VC interest in AI, creating an environment ripe for rapid scaling.
	•	This “right place, right time” factor cannot be overstated—being born in a country with the infrastructure and capital markets to support such ventures is a significant advantage.

6. Structural Inequality and Resource Access
	•	Scale AI’s initial success also reflects systemic inequalities in wealth distribution. Billions of dollars in venture capital are concentrated in the hands of a small number of investors, most of whom are based in the U.S., especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley.
	•	The barriers to entry for people from underprivileged or less connected backgrounds remain high, as they lack access to the networks and initial funding necessary to launch comparable ventures.

Conclusion: “Born with Access” as a Factor

While Alexandr Wang is undoubtedly intelligent and driven, his rise cannot be separated from the structural advantages he had:
	•	Growing up in a scientifically literate and supportive family.
	•	Attending elite educational institutions.
	•	Gaining access to venture capital through Silicon Valley networks.
	•	Operating in a country with robust financial and technological infrastructure.


This is a common pattern among billionaire entrepreneurs: the interplay of individual effort with systemic privilege. While the “self-made” narrative dominates public discourse, deeper analysis often reveals the outsized role of environment, connections, and access to capital"

H800s are a special downgraded version of the H100 GPU with less interconnect bandwidth. This means the H800 series is generally 30-40% less performant when training LLMs. Nvidia made these H800s according to US sanction restrictions specifically to sell to the Chinese market.

So basically US CEOs claim that DeepSeek has 50,000 H100 GPUs when DeepSeek's paper says they used only 2,000 H800 GPUs. This is a 25x difference in computing power, not even considering the fact that H800 is 30-40% less powerful than H100."

People who are still not convinced can wait for some US labs to start making fine-tuned DeepSeek R1 models. You'll see that no matter during pretraining, RL, SLT, or inference, the DeepSeek model will be magnitudes cheaper and more efficient. It is down to the architecture (MoE, MLA) and parameter size.

Edit: People downvoting are forgetting that inference costs for o1 and R1 reasoning type models are much more important than regular LLM inference costs, since they need to do CoT to get best results."

I just see so clearly, it is even laughable but sad and scary (especially with how much more power US has and what can happen if it all goes along the course of decline and rising anger), tendencies that happened in the society of my own country and hurt it greatly, culminating in growing weaknesses and then some intense bullshit.

...I see the parallels with US-China competition, decline and society feeling vulnerable after a long time of being (mostly) unrivaled.

Anything that can help the society to go back on track of ""healthy"" competition and healthy, balanced belief in themselves/society as a whole/their country, and their decent/bright future, will be of great help, but by default it is not the road that most people, and society as a whole, go.

Anything that resembles mass laughing, dismissing and diminishing of a decline and/or rising competitors, or turns into fearful/angry/insulted aggression, is immensely destructive in long or short term.

This would require you to hire 5/20 of the female applicants and 5/80 of the male applicants. If you assume the talent distribution of male and female applicants is equal (which you should, if you're arguing for equality), then this cannot be a fair process, since you only have to be in the top 25% of female applicants to get a job, but have to be in the top 6.25% of male applicants to get a job."

And to clarify, affirmative action isn't DEI. I think in general I agree more with DEI than I do with affirmative action."

Such a framing misses the deeper, more critical conversation about wealth distribution and economic equity. While America's GDP has grown significantly in recent years, this prosperity has not been felt equally across society. For the vast majority of Americans, the economic boom has been invisible—rents continue to climb, grocery prices remain inflated, tuition costs are soaring, and wages have stagnated. These challenges highlight a stark disconnect between overall economic growth and the lived experiences of everyday people.

The issue, then, is not necessarily that individuals have amassed billion-dollar fortunes in a thriving economy. Rather, the real problem lies in the systemic failure to ensure that this wealth is distributed more equitably. When the benefits of economic growth are concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority struggle to keep up with rising costs, it creates a deeply unequal society. The conversation should focus on how to create systems and policies that ensure prosperity is shared more broadly, enabling everyone to thrive in an economy that, by all measures, has the capacity to support them."

This is true for **inference** (running the model) which anyone can verify by downloading the DeepSeek models and measuring it on their local computer. This is likely also true for **training** costs according to DeepSeek's paper, and also because reinforcement learning (RL) training requires a lot of inference during the process."

And, to be honest, in essence, most ideas in AI/neural networks are... very, VERY simple and often even elegant, for those with some knowledge and abilities. It's not quite something that would be hard to know, understand, for other clever people.

The hard, ultra-costly part is checking out which combinations of ideas work at huge scales, with what parameters do they work the best, how to modify these parameters during the training process, and so on. Sometimes/often literally checking some ""magic numbers"" to more or less know which ones \*should\* work best for a huge and freaking expensive model training run, preferably before beginning it (testing on models of smaller scale, and hoping it would work... not worse on a much larger scale).  
Often checking if some old idea from the past, that everybody has dismissed, actually began to work at current, large scales.

So, it, kind of, wouldn't be that much needed to steal whole ideas, but it could save a LOT of time and money to steal the wisdom, results of trial and error, - the knowledge of specific ways to apply these ideas. Because you, again, literally can't just try them out again and again until they work, it's very expensive.

But to be honest, it seems like most technological knowledge spread/competition/secrets and gatekeeping between countries/companies of \~similar level of abilities, is exactly about keeping precise small details hidden, not whole concepts, so, AI, I guess, is not too different.

Anyways, they have made a technical report telling about some/most of what they have applied to their new models, and people with knowledge may proof some of it based on the model file (that can be downloaded).

OpenAI and such still have an upper hand, because more hardware can ALWAYS be turned into more intelligence, but I wonder why big companies didn't look much into very fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts models so far, it seems? DeepSeek just did the obvious thing in that regard, efficiency-wise. I really don't understand why others didn't. Were afraid of drawbacks, and focused on many other things?  
They will easily implement similar things into their next models, anyways. Google's Pro/Flash models, and OpenAI's o3 mini are possibly MoEs already. Original GPT-4 was a MoE too, albeit with only 8 experts, and likely an older approach to ""specializing"" them."
