I haven't tried the others. But I just want to say that many of the criticisms that I have seen of Duolingo are based on an earlier version of the app. The French course is really good now, at least for taking you from beginner to intermediate. It includes listening, speaking and writing exercises in addition to reading and learning vocab and grammar. And I use the free version, so the subscription course may be even better. These apps are not static, they do respond to user feedback. Some of the courses that remain weak are probably due to a relative scarcity of native speakers to assist in developing the course."

It’s a series of recorded lessons you follow along with of a teacher teaching French to a student from the beginning. They tie concepts to things that are familiar to English speakers, starting with words that are the same or similar in both languages. It’s not a particularly good vocabulary builder but their Spanish series really helped me improve my ability to think in Spanish and put my thoughts into sentences in real time.

duolingo has been really good for me for the repetition and has been very useful for grammar for me. using grammar concepts and seeing them used is much better for me than trying to read an explanation in a text book. it’s also a very long course, and on days where i don’t have the time/energy/motivation, i can just spend 5 minutes on duolingo and have still learnt something"

As for the topics being “random,” this is true of virtually all language learning. I agree it’s not woven into some broader immersive storyline, but not everyone needs that to learn effectively. I’ve read various views on this, and tried out some of the “story learning” approaches (including Story Learning, lol) but they aren’t more effective for me than any other methods.

As for having real life conversations, I agree that Duolingo will probably not get you there, and definitely won’t do it on its own.

I learned Spanish in Guatemala, four months in an immersion school six hours per day of one-on-one tutoring. At nights I'd do my homework, work through graded readers, and a couple times a week went to language exchanges with locals. I was a serious learner by just about any definition.

My friend, what an achievement. I'm super happy for you!

I've been resting on a plateau since I finally reached my long term goal about 4 years ago. But of course I've had thoughts sneak up on me, like: Oh, it could be cool to learn this or that language.

This post is not only testament to your achievement, it is also super motivating. Now I'm thinking about picking one of them up, just to see how far I can get in 8 months!

Okay from being unsure when I clicked reply I'm gonna go ahead and reinstall Duolingo now for the first time in years, I'll see you on the other side lmao"

Given the fact that you now have a solid B1 level, which is amazing in that shord period of time, i would highly recommend you to stop learning about grammar and just start listening to a lot of content by watching shows, reading articles and in general immerse yourself in spanish content as much as possible, because that is in my opinion the best way to advance, and the best part of it is, that you are not even studying, but having fun all the time by doing things that you would do normally anyway (i love watching tv shows for example). i stopped studying actively as soon as i had a good understanding of the grammar and was able to understand things just by looking at the context."

It took me about 6 months. I have to say I came to completely the opposite conclusion to you.

Duolingo's main goal is to drive engagement (because it's revenue comes from ads), not teach you languages. There isn't actually much teaching going on, they rarely explain anything. At best it's good as a quick practice tool when you already understand the grammar concepts it's throwing at you.

Babbel takes you through proper lessons, explaining each part and breaking down concepts. It can occasionally be a little dry, but that's because it's trying to teach you and not entertain you. Some things are important to understand but boring to explain, that's just how it is.

I personally credit Babbel with playing a large part in my Spanish learning journey, it helped take me from being a complete beginner to having a solid understanding of the grammar. The only reason I was able to complete the Duolingo tree was because of what I was learning from Babbel in tandem."

Yes, Duolingo may be more fun and keep people coming back for their streak, but Babbel actually teaches the languages decently well. It's a textbook in app form. And as such, it does a good job.

Are textbooks the most fun and engaging learning tools? Surely not, never were. But they're great for giving structure and a solid foundation upon which to build with more engaging content, e.g. graded readers, learner podcasts, etc., in order to finally make the jump to native-level materials.

You mention more diverse words on Duolingo. Let me ask you something in return: Where is the context for those words? Duolingo throws individual words and phrases at you. Phrases, may I say so, that may or may not make any sense in the real world. Sure, they may be more fun (and yes, fun is one possible element that helps us remember things), but they're learnt in isolation.

Babbel on the other hand introduces new words and phrases related to a common topic, and give context for them through their practise conversations in most units. Which, beyond the simple dictionary translation, gives learners an idea of how and when to use them (since most words aren't 1:1 equivalent translations between languages).

In short, if you're looking for something fun to do that may also teach you something while you do it, sure, Duolingo might be great for you! However, if you seriously want to learn a language, Babbel's approach definitely wins out. That being said, neither app will get you very far without also using other resources."

But they aren't hooked on learning, they're hooked on the game. That's why it's fun. Learning is uncomfortable and progressive. Duolingo is such low value-add that calling it ""learning"" is misrepresentation, which is precisely why they're more than happy to have users on there for 5 years who still can't speak the damn language and stumble through the basics that their peers learned 4 years before them.

If you knew language learning then you'd quickly see that Duolingo has made a number of app/feature/platform changes to attract and retain users, but at the sacrifice of actual learning. They've removed features that are good for learning. Their focus is ad revenue, subs, and user retention, not teaching languages."

I sure believe that only using Duolingo won‘t help to learn the language properly. You need more. So I‘m using the App StudyCards to learn new words or grammar. For grammar explanation I‘m relying on free explenations from the web.

So why am I using Duolingo if it‘s not enough to learn a language?

With its gamification it keeps me hooked. Also the community can answer the questions other learners have. Last but not least, contrarry to what others say here, I think that it has a clear structure and different topics which build on each other."

Babbel's voice narration is clear, at a good pace, and you can hear how it would sound in a real conversation.

Duolingo's narration for me is either too fast/too slow/ generally difficult to understand/noticibly computer voiced.

As well my favorite feature of babbel is the listening review. I believe duolingo has recently added a feature like that, but I currently dont have Plus. And the audio in the app frustrates me as mentioned anyway. I feel in the month I spent taking a break from duo(I have used duo on and off since like 2017, and have been most active using it for the past year or so)to try babbel and I have improved quite a bit.

As nice as the quick game lessons on duo are, having my eyes open to realizing how frustrating the audio is has ruined it for me. Ontop of the fact that unless you have Plus the app feels punishing to use (excesive ads, losing hearts) where as with babbel if i make a mistake it moves on, i can correct myself without disrupting the lesson, and it will be added to my review anyway."

Currently using the paid Family Plan ($120/year for 3 of us). I’m well into the intermediate level after about 5 months. I find it’s a great way to restore my Spanish memory. However, I have 3 major issues. One, I don’t need it to be a game, I find my competitive nature makes me want to win more than learn. But I like the format, it’s interactive and varied. Babbel feels like I’m just learning a word at a time, not really developing my skill in the language. I lose interest in it rather quickly.

Second issue. I find far, far too many cases where Duolingo does not sufficiently clarify what they want in an answer. “You” for example can be túor usted or ustedes, and the cute little picture doesn’t give enough context to know which form they want. Yet, only one form is considered correct. Sometimes the sentence gives context, such as paren speaking to child or vice versa, but not always. 

Third issue. As I’ve progressed, I find the lesson content increasingly repetitive. For instance, many of the listening exercises I have seen so many times I can answer it without hearing more than the first few words. This doesn’t measure or develop my listening skills, it simply tests my memory, and that only marginally enhances my skill level.

Fortunately, my sister-in-law is a native Spanish speaker, and she ever so lovingly refuses to speak English with me, so I get abundant (and greatly appreciated) real-life practice. That has far more impact on my learning than either Duo or Babbel."

That's fine if you state what you value from the beginning, but you're effectively ignoring the fact that there are different target groups in language learning. Duolingo has increasingly gone for the casual crowd and their design reflects that.

How long have you actually used these apps btw? Because one of the biggest complaints regarding Duo is that the app does a great job of keeping you going every day, *without teaching you that much.* The gamification becomes a direct detriment, for example because you're encouraged to prioritise tasks with high XP returns instead of those that actually target the most important language concepts.

Duo is great for beginners to dip their toes in, but you really have to branch out from there or you'll be treading water for a long time."

Which, beyond the simple dictionary translation, gives learners an idea of how and when to use them (since most words aren't 1:1 equivalent translations between languages).

While this is for the most part legit, it is not entirely the case.

Assuming Stories is still an available feature, Duo *does* actually put you through proper language use once you’re on a bit. The biggest problem being that it was only ever available for in-house languages rather than volunteer ones.

Let me tell you something. My ‘discipline’ and my ‘attention span’ are just fine, thanks. I am not 12. 

But what I DONT have are any viable alternatives  that will not turn learning a language into a thing that requires a second job to finance. 

I cannot afford $21 a month for each language. For me, that is $63 per month, and that is just to brush up on Russian learned in college, learn Italian from scratch, and learn Ukrainian (a number of similarities with Russian in the beginning - it was the real goal, brushing up on Russian is just happening as a result because getting into Cyrillic again is bringing Russian back at odd times so I need to do both) assuming they even HAVE it. So Ukrainian might be even more expensive because hardly anyone carries it. 

Plus buying tons of books and materials to make flash cards. 

Duolingo is free. I just do something else during the ads. I do drills to get hearts, not watch more ads. I work out the grammar and memorize it via drillings I don’t care about the game, really. I have no idea where I am in the league. I use the XP, but only to set learning targets for the day. And the streaks are fine with me because on the rare occasion I don’t feel like it, the steak gets me to show up anyway, and once I do that, I do the work.  

You guys in here just have your own little exclusive club, and your little ‘brag flags’, but to people like me, you could care less. Not even a post pinned to the top of the forum with suggested resources for newbies, and when we ask questions in threads they are barely responded to. 

I’d really love for someone in this forum to quit complaining about duolingo for just one day and write me a post of specific books I should buy instead. Specific podcasts to listen to. Specific programs to make flashcards with. So I don’t waste anymore money on books and resources that are utterly useless. 

Break it down for me. 

If duolingo sucks so much, someone give me specific books and podcasts etc to do instead. For Ukrainian, Russian and Italian. Even one of them. 

I came to this sub for help, but I’m getting the impression that that is not what the members here what this forum to be about. 

It’s just disingenuous to say this is about language learning when people don’t answer your newbie questions and there is not even a master list of suggested resources for the inevitable hoards of duolingo users who come here and are told in no uncertain terms that they are wasting their time. 

It’s very frustrating. 

I get not wanting to answer these questions over and over. I do! But jeez! Make a master thread then if you guys are gonna dis duolingo so hard. 

People who come here really do want to learn these languages. And we don’t want to ‘waste our time’. But we need real, affordable and most if all, specific alternatives if we are gonna be told that duolingo sux by 99% of the people in here."

I agree that the first kind of textbook is not a great tool for self-learners to use.

The second kind of textbook, however, can be an amazing starting tool (and one I've used personally with success, and at least once as my only study tool until I was done with it and started branching out).

Babbel is a ""textbook as an app"" of the second kind, made for self-learners, and as such it can be a really valuable tool for beginners, just like other textbooks of this kind.

That being said, textbook work may not be the ideal way to start for everyone, but given how many people come here and to the other learning subs feeling lost because they don't know how to structure their self-learning, I don't really understand why not more learners at least try to start with a textbook that does the structure for them."

A proper grammar book to look up concepts, depending on your other resources (e.g. whether you use a textbook or not) maybe a learner grammar that includes exercises and breaks down concepts into smaller portions.

Reading and listening material at your level or just slightly above (comprehensible input); for beginners, graded readers with accompanying audio are king (but unfortunately not available for all languages).

A good dictionary (online or as a book), bilingual to start with, monolingual later on (although I still use bilingual dictionaries in advanced stages too, but monolingual dictionaries are better for understanding in which context and how a word or phrase is used, and to understand the nuances as most words don't translate 1:1).

What is ""overly gamified"" tho? Because I think that gamification offends some people on an emotional level and they react to it. Granted, these are often people who are very dedicated and capable. But, a lot of gamification criticism comes from the ""it should be uncomfortable and hard"" angle,  it is more of moral judgement then judgement of the effectivity. It is not about whether gamification brings results or remove results."

Make it challenging then. Engaging, yet challenging. Duolingo is easy and about dopamine. Learning needs a steeper curve, but steeper curve = more obstables = less dopamine = less users.

If you want to be innovative make the Dark Souls of language games (but in a language format, not a video game). Challenging, yet engaging. But with that, as you know, most people don't like challenge so it will be niche.

There's also a question about how much should be gaming and how much is actually learning. Some people switch the language in their video games. They dump 300h into the gameplay and maybe 30h-40h into reading & listening? That actually does work... though I hope people only report that as 40h of learning.

If Duolingo wanted to improve they would add significantly more challenging content and much earlier in their courses, while minimizing the alienation of their main userbase."

Sometime is feel like I’m surrounded by a certain number of language learning snobs who seem to be so offended by the silly animations in duolingo that they can’t see how anyone could learn anything from it. Like, learning a language must be painstaking and grueling for it to count. 😆 Like, it must be un-fun or it’s not learning! It must be hard, boring, and a monumental feat. 

But yet, I see no pinned post in this sub with suggestions for beginners with any alternatives for how to study their chosen language.  And only just a vague ‘alternative sources’ as the mantra. Almost like these ‘alternative sources’ are a trade secret. 

Yes, people know how to buy index cards and make flash cards. But that doesn’t sound like what people really do for flash cards here. 🤷‍♀️ No explanation tho of what they do instead of physical flash cards. 

They say to watch TV shows. I actually do that, but as a beginner I pick up very little. No explanation of what I’m supposed to be trying to accomplish with TV shows I don’t understand. 

For Ukrainian, I also watch reels and reels and reels from the war on Instagram, by the way. I don’t understand much at all of what they are saying. But I use the translate feature to read the comments. I do not think this activity is helping me at all. But I do it because I care about the war. Not to learn Ukrainian. And that’s a good thing. Because I’ve watched hundreds of reels and have not learned anything from them in terms of language learning. 

But I must be doing all of this wrong because people say in here to do it. 🤷‍♀️

I have purchased a student A1 dictionary and use it. I also have purchased a few children’s books and those are helpful.  These are the ONLY things that have been helpful to me besides duolingo. 

I purchased a ‘level 1’ textbook tho and that was a complete waste of money. It’s no way level 1. Long sentences in Cyrillic on the first page is not level 1.  Good thing I already read Cyrillic or I’d have thrown it in the wood stove by now. But a few new letters in Ukrainian…so there’s that.  I guess I’m supposed to learn those by psychic reading. 

But it’s the only book on Amazon. 🤷‍♀️ So that ‘textbook’ avenue is apparently a bust. 🥺

I was really happy doing duolingo until I found this sub. Now I feel like they think I’m wasting my time, even tho I have so far gleaned zero real alternatives from reading tons of posts.

And which language? 

I see all this hate for duolingo, but I’m doing Ukrainian on it (and also brushing up on Russian from college).  I cannot afford expensive programs or a stack of books a mile high. I already wasted money on texts and I’m frustrated with that approach. 

I purchased a student dictionary and a couple of kids books first. Those are great. But I also purchased a ‘Level 1’ text from Amazon…and no way was it is beginner level. I have no idea what they are talking about, even in the first lesson. And I took two years of college Russian so I already read Cyrillic. They launch into Ukrainian in Cyrillic on page one with no explanation and things I never learned in Russian. I can’t even imagine how people who don’t read Cyrillic don’t just give up on the spot! 🥺 A complete waste of money. 

So I have no idea what the story is with these ‘level 1’ textbooks from Amazon. But they are not level 1. And I can’t afford to keep trying different ones until I find one that is truly beginner.

As for watching TV, people here usually won't tell you to go straight to native content. A number that gets mentioned sometimes is that you want texts and videos with around 90% comprehensible input. That way you can mostly follow along with the grammar and vocabulary, and that 10% is there to challenge you and get you to a higher level.

> I was really happy doing duolingo until I found this sub. Now I feel like they think I’m wasting my time, even tho I have so far gleaned zero real alternatives from reading tons of posts.

I have 340 days streak and am in the middle of the unit 15. I can read  Ukrainian cyrilics now kind of like a child by the beginning of the second grade. I am starting to be able to read short jokes (assuming I know the words they use) and understand a thing here and there when watching Netflix in Ukrainian. Sometimes whole sentences, sometimes just a word in them. But, I know another slavic language well, it helps with vocabulary somewhat. I can guess meaning of some words. Netflix in Ukrainian helps me more then youtube, because I can turn on subtitles. Plus, I lucked into some shows where they did talked more slowly and I suspect they used easier ""everyday"" language then news do.

Last week I found one pretty interesting tip: watch show in language you do understand with subtitles in language you are learning. It did not occurred to me to do that before. That way you are exposing yourself to reading that language, but with little cost.

--------------------

Yeah, maybe if I took some intensive lessons, I could be much further in Ukrainian. But I would never put in that much effort in practice. I have work that requires mental effort and kids and other hobbies. There is no way I would be where I am without duolingo. Plus, I found it motivating - I ended up adding some more courses just because. I am contend proceeding slowly, because it is still faster progress then alternative. Plus, I actually find it fun and find gamification motivating. So, at worst, I played a game for a year.

But, I think that actual progress I made for very little effort, in a way that felt fun, is quite real.

And second, one of the languages I added is the one I used to be fluent with and forgot. It did helped me a lot in that use case too - 5 months ago I was not able to watch movies in that language and now I am. (Somehow it is helping me to recall it all)."

For a beginner, this means graded readers, beginner podcasts, beginner Youtube teachers, grammar books, textbooks, reading basic articles, CEFR aligned exercises/assignments, flash cards for vocabulary as a supplement to these activities, focused speaking practice (debatable if you should begin later, after input), accent practice, in some cases TV shows or children's content (optional) if you're like A0 but at A2 one should start on easy native content. 

If learning is daunting—and this is one's first time learning a language—the most value derived from an app is in the very beginning, so if you wanted to use an app for a few months in tandem with these activities that's perfectly fine but the goal should be to graduate from these apps as soon as possible (not necessarily to completion).

You do not have to do all of them at once. Choosing which you want to do and focusing on 2-3 at a time and rotating every few weeks is perfectly fine, if not encouraged. The most important thing is that the beginner stage is focused on input because you need to first build a language database before you're able to output."

How much is your time worth to you? How much is your headspace or mental real estate worth to you? How much do you value knowing a new language?

Ads are designed to be intrusive, whether loud or flashy or whatever else; they are specifically designed to steal your attention. A lesson takes usually 45s to 90s, perhaps for some challenging, novel lessons 120s. An ad is usually 15s. Some ads, as I mentioned are typically optional, are 30s and serve to continue using the game or unlock basic features. You're wasting a few more seconds clicking away from these ads to new lessons. Perhaps you put your phone down and pick it up later hoping the ad is over, but you can't do that precisely so you'll waste even more time on average.

When your brain is in a learning state it's more sensitive and plastic. It's a crucial time for downloading, sorting, and saving new information. I'm sure you agree that one learns less when they are not focused. Ads are designed to distract and disrupt. In Duolingo they occur at one of the worst times and very frequently.

I think that yes and no. I think that it is at its best when you spend 5-15 minutes per language on it. For me, more then that and my retention is going down by a lot. Every time I binged, I remembered less from it.

I kind of disagree here. To large extend, I currently feel like that ""just doing it"" works, because that verb of word is repeated often enough for me to eventually remembering forms.

There are full-time, immersive language schools in China, Japan, Thailand, and US where you will be doing this within a few months. The US has a school that's like $13,000 for 8 weeks to get to B1 speaking in romance languages. The Asian schools are longer because the languages are harder, and still very effective.

If Spanish has lessons where you have to listen for 2 minutes that's something that is not available in most of Duolingo's courses.

Dreaming Spanish, I'm not that familiar other than know the guy uses comprehensible input and well-studied methods (unlike Duolingo). So I can't comment on the ad part of DS, but the  method is certainly far superior as many users here report getting to the B1 level in less than a year.

Spanish on Duolingo is heralded as one of the best because it's long, but it's arguably one of the worst because it takes way too long and one should be increasing the difficult of content much sooner. Spending 3-5 yrs to finish a Spanish tree is a big mistake. One can accomplish all of that in probably 8 months by not using Duolingo.

The other exercises in the set will also  read you sentences in Spanish with the text and you either answer questions or translate.  So to be clear, I am not saying any one audio is more than 2 minutes but that you will often hear 2 minutes of audio between ads.  Part of the reason that listening all the way through is important. 



Those that get to B1 in Dreaming Spanish have spent more hours total in doing it.  I also don’t believe that anyone has tested B1 in it with less than 1,000 hours since he recommends you start reading, writing, and listening after the 1,000 hour point.  Similar to how high school courses are totally inadequate comparatively but they typically have 100-125 actual hours of Spanish instruction per year (50-55 minutes classes about 180 days a year with other activities that are not Spanish instruction taking up part of that time) with long breaks between years and non motivated students.  It isn’t a fair comparison.

Our schools also have French immersion where in High School you take 10 classes in French: 4 Core French (and 4 English), but also 6 additional classes in French across the humanities like history geo philosophy etc (science, math sans Francais). That's grades 4-12 where the rigor jumps in high school to reading novels, writing essays, and understanding audio. Most people can't speak much at all because that's not graded. As for the level, they cover up to B2 content by the final year except for speaking. But with a couple months intensive practice they jump up to B1 in speaking.

we can only trace language back so far, not to it's absolute origin. No one is denying that languages evolved over time, but we are saying God caused different languages to occur, which forced humans to spread out, which led to a branching of languages that originated across the whole world.

>On top of that, we’ve overcome the language problem.

True. We also haven't attempted to build a giant tower to get to heaven again. Remember, the main issue with Babel was that people weren't spreading out. They were all staying in one place, which was direct disobedience from what God told them to do. Humans are all over the world now, there's no need to split us up again.

>In the story, God says that humans can achieve anything if we can communicate with one another. We can now all communicate, and clearly this was not the thing preventing us from achieving anything. There are still quite a few things we cannot achieve

the moment instantaneous communication became widespread, technological advancement accelerated at a rapid rate. It hasn't slowed down much since then.

Also it doesn't literally mean we can do anything, we aren't collectively omnipotent. The point is that whatever we as a human race put our mind to will eventually be done."

But I'd like to throw out a couple tidbits you may or may not find useful.

In the Hebrew culture, there were 10 ""Heavens"". The lowest heaven being the air around you - the atmosphere. It ranged up through the sky, the cosmos, the spiritual realm, with the tenth heaven being the dwelling place and throne room of the Most High God.  So using the term heaven there is pretty basic - it was gunna be tall.

I've heard three ideas bandied about on the purpose of the tower. 1) it was going to be tall enough that they could climb it to survive another flood.
2) it was going to reach to the clouds so that they could see bad weather coming from far enough away they could prepare for it
3) my personal favorite theory - it was a space launch platform, attempting to recreate antediluvian advanced technology they'd heard about from Noah's sons.

I completely agree. It’s clearly a morality tale that cautions against putting faith in our own abilities rather than God. But that’s not the literal reading. In the literal reading, God stops them because if he doesn’t then they might achieve their goal.

On top of this, why would we expect a morality tale to be literal history? Why do some people seem to feel that it *needs* to be literal history or it loses its value?"

The gospels were written for a variety of reasons, but one of those reasons is to use Jesus' ministry as a ""morality tale."" After all, if we're supposed to imitate Jesus, then we need to know what He did. 

The gospel is, of course, also a very literal story of events that actually occurred. It can be more than 1 thing at once."

They are the experiences and recollections of the individual authors. Yes, we are supposed to immigrate Christ. But the gospels do not follow the structure of a morality tale, nor do they serve the same purpose. That’s a specific genre. More specifically, the Tower of Babel is a [etiology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_myth).

There’s multiple problems with reading Genesis in a literal historical way. The most obvious is that it doesn’t match up with anything we know about the history of humanity. If a person has been taught their whole life that Genesis is literal history and is then confronted with this fact, they tend to respond in one of two bad ways. They either reject their faith or they reject science. Neither of these are good.

But another problem is that taking it as literal history leads one to completely miss most of the actual meaning and value of Genesis. It doesn’t allow for properly placing it in its cultural and historical context and seeing how it actually fits with Christ’s teachings. Reading the entire Old Testament as strictly literal history would lead one to conclude that God had a hard shift in personality at some point."

I'm interested to hear your opinion on the parts of the Genesis story that have been shown to be true. Like Noah's flood. Also the scientific evidence to support a literal 6 day creation.

I'm not 100% convinced that Moses personally sat down and wrote Genesis. Its possible, but I think oral traditions are mostly to credit for the information we have.  That being said, there are big parts of Genesis that literally did happen. Or at the least, there's every bit as much evidence for the Bible, as opposed to it."
